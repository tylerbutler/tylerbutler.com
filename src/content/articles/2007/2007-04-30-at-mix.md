I'm at MIX! Got in late last night. Wow, Vegas is nuts. So gaudy -- lights,
sounds, smells everywhere. It's pretty overwhelming. The Venetian is
fantastically humongous. I have to walk a mile from my room to the part of the
hotel where MIX is actually taking place. First time in a 5-star hotel for me,
so I am pleased.

Right now I am sitting in the keynote session waiting for it to get started at
9:30 PST. There's a pretty cool "screen saver" thing that is loading live
[Twitter][1] comments from MIX attendees and displaying them on the screen in
real-time. Pretty cool. Not a big Twitter fan myself, but it's certainly being
used in interesting ways here at MIX.

There's a three piece band playing with an accordion, violin, upright bass,
and assorted other instruments. One attendee described it as a love child
between Tom Waits and Oingo Boingo. Did I just hear a glockenspiel? A freakin'
Theremin too? Fantastic…

Well, keynote should start shortly… More coming up...
