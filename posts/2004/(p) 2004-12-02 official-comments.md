In case you haven't noticed, [my novel is done][1]. Well, at least the 50,000
words are done, so I am a [NaNoWriMo][2] winner. I still need to edit it, and
with some artistic help from Joe Parry, I will add some illustrations and lay
it out in InDesign or something to make a nice PDF booklet. I am also going to
write up an essay on the experience of NaNoWriMo and my influences for the
book. But that's in the future. I know at least one or two people have been
following along throughout the month, so now is the time for you to let me
have it... I will be putting some polls up soon for people that have read the
novel, but if you want to compliment me or criticize me for anything in the
book, comment in this post or send me an email. I really want feedback...
seriously. It's the only way to improve.
