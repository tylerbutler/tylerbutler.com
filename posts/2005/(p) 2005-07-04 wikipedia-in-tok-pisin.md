While visiting Wikipedia this morning, I saw a link to the [Tok Pisin
version.][1] There doesn't seems to be a whole lot there, and the spelling and
grammer strikes me as being quite bad, but even so, I think it's pretty cool.
I might need to start contributing some to keep my Pidgin skills up to par.
Also of interest: the [main Wikipedia article on Tok Pisin][2] and [an entry
on Wikibooks][3] with more about the grammatical structure. Of course, nothing
beats hearing it spoken for real, so give me a call and listen to the real
deal!
