                                    <p>This article, titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/05/AR2009030504104.html?hpid=topnews">Give Us a Commercial Break!</a>&#8221; from the Wall Street
Journal is <strong>way</strong> off the mark in my opinion. The article states that <span class="caps">TV</span>
shows are written with commercials in mind and that watching them without
commercials changes them. That in and of itself I can&#8217;t argue with. But I do
take issue with the implication that this is uniformly&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>There are two core arguments in the&nbsp;article:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="caps">TV</span> shows are written with commercials specifically in mind, and removing them completely interrupts the pacing of the&nbsp;show. </li>
<li>Viewers actually like shows with ads&nbsp;better.</li>
</ol>
<p>For argument number one, it&#8217;s obvious that writers take commercial breaks into
consideration when writing <span class="caps">TV</span> shows. However, in their <span class="caps">DVD</span> counterparts, the
breaks are preserved as scene changes. These can seem rather abrupt, and I
think this points to an alternative solution: slightly longer breaks for scene
changes that are replacing commercial breaks. If we assume the normal scene
change is a second, then imagine that the commercial-break-replacement scene
change is three seconds. You can simulate this suggestion by hitting pause for
three seconds – I think you&#8217;ll be surprised at the results. I think you&#8217;ll
agree that this is uniformly better than&nbsp;ads.</p>
<p>For argument number two, I can&#8217;t refute the research. But there is a quote
from the article that is completely asinine in my&nbsp;opinion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From an audience member&#8217;s perspective, they are what makes network
television social. We use the commercial breaks to talk amongst ourselves, to
take bets on the J.D./Elliot situation and to decide that no one ever really
dies on&nbsp;&#8220;Lost.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say what? That we need commercial breaks to be social is ridiculous. In this
day and age, we have ready access to the Pause button, and it&#8217;s a far more
useful tool for fostering discussion while watching <span class="caps">TV</span>. Elizabeth and I
have been watching quite a few documentaries lately, and we pause quite often
to talk about whether or not we agree with what&#8217;s being said. I agree that
adding discussion and dialog while viewing a show is positive (there&#8217;s a
reason fans get together to watch episodes of their favorite shows), but I
think people use the commercial breaks because they&#8217;re there, not because they
<strong>need</strong> them in order to have that conversation&nbsp;successfully.</p>
<p>I hate ads in all forms (though I can appreciate particularly clever or well-
done ones), so I am definitely biased here. But seriously&#8230; there&#8217;s a reason
<span class="caps">DVD</span> copies of shows sell so well, and it isn&#8217;t because people are dying to own
season one of “Scrubs” for&nbsp;eternity&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>The server that is currently hosting the SharePoint version of tylerbutler.com
is being decommissioned. Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t given much notice about this
so I have not been able to secure an alternative SharePoint-ready location at
Microsoft to host the site. In the meantime I&#8217;ve used this opportunity to move
the site over to WordPress, and I&#8217;ve refreshed the look and feel. Hopefully
this will be temporary, since I intend to rebuild the site on the new version
of SharePoint once it&#8217;s publicly available. But in the meantime, WordPress is
serving my&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>The main www address should be redirecting to blog.tylerbutler.com as soon as
the <span class="caps">DNS</span> changes propogate. The main <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed should be switched over, but I
have not yet moved the others. Regardless, though, you shouldn&#8217;t notice any
differences since I&#8217;m using&nbsp;FeedBurner.</p>

of them a thousand times, it was awesome to sit back and watch other people
experience them for the first time. I also read a lot of stories growing up,
and I developed a special love for short stories in particular (I especially
like O.&nbsp;Henry).</p>
<p>While I was in college, I discovered a site that I have since lost many hours
of my life to &#8211; <a href="http://www.folklore.org/">folklore.org</a>. It&#8217;s a site put together by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld">Andy
Hertzfeld</a> (not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hertzfeldt">Don Hertzfeldt</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejected">Rejected</a>
fame), and contains &#8220;anecdotes about the development of Apple&#8217;s original
Macintosh computer, and the people who created it.&#8221; It is incredible &#8211; it
combines my love of stories with a topic I find interesting &#8211; the early days
of personal computing. Best of all, the stories there are written by the
people who experienced it, and often contain a healthy dose of humor and
humanity. But behind that, there&#8217;s some cool technical details about the
challenges the engineers faced, and why some of the decisions got made the way
they did. I find that part of it utterly&nbsp;spellbinding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for other sites like this for other tech companies,
like Atari or even Microsoft. The closest I&#8217;ve found for Atari is
<a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/">DadHacker.com</a>, written by a guy who worked for Atari back in the day. His
blog is interesting in a variety of ways, but I particularly like his Atari
posts. In fact, his post titled <a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=987">Donkey Kong and Me</a> was what got him into
my <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader permanently. It&#8217;s good &#8211; you should read&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I actually work with a developer who was also on the team that developed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy">Clippy</a>, and I&#8217;ve heard some interesting stories for him about what that
was like. Maybe I&#8217;ll try to convince him to write up some of his experiences&#8230;
I am sure there are some more great stories out there… If you know of some
sites, please do point me to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Because I find this stuff so interesting, I thought it would be good to start
chronicling some of the stuff I know about because I&#8217;ve been working on
SharePoint. Thus, I plan to write a series titled &#8220;But Why?&#8221; about various
SharePoint features that I either worked on or have been exposed to, and why
they behave the way they do. These posts will be one part SharePoint history,
one part storytelling, and if I do it right, will pull back the curtain a bit
so you can see just why things wound up the way they&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>But first, some disclaimers: These posts are my own thoughts and opinions, and
do not reflect those of Microsoft or of anyone else who works/worked on
SharePoint. Also, my memory may be fuzzy and blatantly incorrect about some
things, so everything should be viewed through that lens. Finally, you
shouldn&#8217;t expect these posts to be as interesting as anything you read on&nbsp;folklore.org.</p>

                                    <p>Wow, it&#8217;s been awhile. Almost a year since my last post. It truly is hard to
believe. It&#8217;s been a busy year so far, but I&#8217;ve finally got some time to start
posting again. I&#8217;ve got some interesting SharePoint posts coming down the
pipe, plus a new site design I&#8217;m working on. It&#8217;s still in its early stages,
but hopefully it&#8217;ll shape up pretty soon so I can get a sample&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>One thing you&#8217;ll notice if you&#8217;ve been here before is that I&#8217;ve managed to
move the site into the 21st century by adding comments. I toyed with a few
different comment management add-ins and ended up going with <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. It
seems like it&#8217;ll suit my needs for now, and it was pretty straightforward to
get integrated. Just added some script and markup to my master page and post
page layout in SharePoint Designer. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about the comments
being stored separately from the site content, but it&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got for now.
It will make migration difficult if page <span class="caps">URL</span>&#8217;s change, which they almost
certainly are when I change the architecture of the site in the next redesign.
C&#8217;est la vie, I&#8217;ll cross that bridge when I get to it. Anyway, please go ahead
and engage with me through the comments if you see something interesting on
the&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>I should also note, for completeness, that SharePoint includes a blog template
that supports comments. I, however, <a href="/2006/11/building-tylerbutlercom-on-moss/">rolled my own site</a> and didn&#8217;t use the
blog template or features. There were lots of reasons for this that I won&#8217;t go
into right now, but there are certainly some features that SharePoint blogs
have that I also want, like comments and MetaWeblog support (which I added
myself). For now, I&#8217;m stuck with what I&#8217;ve got. But like I said, there are
some exciting new things coming with my site&nbsp;redesign.</p>
