unbelievable that a retail store has to be <strong>this</strong> frightened of lawsuits to

                                    <p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write for awhile about my outrage over Comiskey Park
(where the White Sox play; it&#8217;s only a couple blocks from my house) becoming
<span class="caps">US</span> Cellular Field. When the change initially took effect, there were many
radio personalities, especially sportscasters, who said they were going to
keep calling it Comiskey. That lasted until someone (no doubt <span class="caps">US</span> Cellular&#8217;s
lawyers) got angry and started suing people. At one point, I think (this has
not been verified, so take it with a grain of salt), the <span class="caps">FCC</span> started levying
fines when someone said &#8220;Comiskey Park&#8221; in reference to &#8220;<span class="caps">US</span> Cellular Field,&#8221;
just like how they fine stations when they slip up and broadcast &#8220;illegal&#8221;
words over the&nbsp;air.</p>
<p>Anyway, the outrage I feel at renaming a historic sports landmark to something
as ridiculous as <span class="caps">US</span> Cellular field may seem unwarranted. But for all you
baseball fans out there, how would you feel if Wrigley Field became Wrigley
Juicy Fruit Gum Arena, or even worse, Spider-Man 2 Movie Coliseum? The problem
is the perversion of our social culture by advertising. There&#8217;s an article
over at k5 that nearly made me cry (out of agreement with what the guy was
saying, not sadness or happiness). Finally, someone else who feels the way I
do. I mean, one of the main reasons I built my own web server was so that I
didn&#8217;t have to host my site somewhere where they advertise all the time. I use
Mozilla Firefox as my browser so the pop-ups don&#8217;t bug me. If slashdot and k5
wouldn&#8217;t advertise, I think I&#8217;d like them even more. I absolutely hate static
advertising. Why does everything <strong>have</strong> to revolve around&nbsp;money?</p>
<p>Interestingly, when I bring this up in conversation, most people I talk to
seem opposed to the idea (though admittedly not as vehemently as I am). So why
aren&#8217;t we fighting this sort of thing? Does our apathy and laziness truly run
that deep? In the end, I am forced to ask the age-old question: Is nothing&nbsp;sacred?</p>

<p>Oh, and I am trying to buy the domain savecomiskey.org, and hope to develop a
site where people can speak out against the evils of advertising. Maybe we
could even buy out <span class="caps">US</span> Cellular&#8217;s share of Comiskey! Then we could call it
whatever we want, right? I mean, money talks&#8230; If you&#8217;re interested in
helping me out, drop me an&nbsp;email.</p>

are unaware, a <span class="caps">MUD</span> is an online multi-user game. (There is a <span class="caps">MUD</span> <span class="caps">FAQ</span> at
<a href="http://www.mudconnect.com/mudfaq/">http://www.mudconnect.com/mudfaq/</a>) Anyway, the game in question is
Achaea, a text-based <span class="caps">MUD</span>. It seems that the creators of the game introduced a
highly addictive substance, called &#8220;gleam,&#8221; into the game environment, and
players&#8217; characters quickly became addicts. The benefit of using gleam is an
increase in the character&#8217;s dexterity, but players who are suffering from
withdrawals after becoming addicts and trying to quit are paying a high price:
it can take up to 25 hours of in-game time to recover from gleam addiction.
Maybe people will learn from this virtual experience? Nope, didn&#8217;t think&nbsp;so&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>Well, as you can see because you&#8217;re here, my diary has been moved here to a
blog. The word &#8220;blog,&#8221; for all of you not well-versed in Internet terminology,
is short for Web Log. A Blog is basically an online journal or diary where
people (in this case, mainly me) can post their thoughts, links to cool
things, etc. I started a diary last summer, but I didn&#8217;t keep it very updated,
and once school started up, I actually forgot all about it. Now summer is here
again, and I am bored out of my mind. I tend to read a lot more now, because I
am so bored, and because of this, I have a lot more things that I want to
respond to. Also, because it is summer, many of my friends are gone, so I have
less people to talk to. So this blog gives me something to do. Also, a blog is
really cool because it allows people to post comments. So if you&#8217;re a friend
of mine, or even a complete stranger, and you have something you want to say,
post a comment in response to one of my posts! Anyway, that&#8217;s about&nbsp;it.</p>
