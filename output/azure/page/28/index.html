                                    <p>I hate a lot of things. There&#8217;s a lot of things that really bug me; that
really get under my skin. But the one thing I am absolutely <strong><em>sick and
tired</em></strong> of hearing about is Senators and Congressman tacking little
provisions onto other relatively benign bills in order to get them passed.
This <strong><em>really</em></strong> pisses me off, because it&#8217;s blatently&nbsp;dishonest!</p>
<p>The latest example of this is the Real <span class="caps">ID</span> Act, written by one Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/sensenbrenner/index.htm">F.
James Sensenbrenner, Jr. </a>(R), of Wisconsin. This act would mandate
national <span class="caps">ID</span> cards for all citizens that are machine readable, with a lot of
personal information going into some big government controlled database. It&#8217;s
being tacked onto a bill giving our troops in Iraq further governmental
financial support. Now, what does a national <span class="caps">ID</span> card system have to do with
passing funding requests for our troops in Iraq? <strong><em>Nothing!</em></strong></p>
<p>This is being voted on <strong>tomorrow</strong>. Here&#8217;s an email from my good friend
Patrick Wagstrom with a little more information about&nbsp;it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>So as part of the &#8220;emergency&#8221; funding bill for the troops, Sen Stensenbrenner
of Wisconsin got the Real <span class="caps">ID</span> bill attached, and it passed the house. The
senate votes on it this Tuesday (<span class="caps">TOMORROW</span>), and Bush will certainly sign the
bill if nothing&nbsp;happens.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a brief overview of what&#8217;s going&nbsp;on:</p>
<p>Real <span class="caps">ID</span> basically mandates a national <span class="caps">ID</span> card. It requires that all state
drivers licenses have a uniform set of data, including biometric data and that
it be readable by a smart card and 2d barcode reader. In addition, this
information will be forwarded to a federal government database of&nbsp;individuals.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s so bad about all this? After all, we don&#8217;t have any privacy left
anyway. Well, the issue is that your information in this centralized database
becomes a requisite for all sorts of things, bank accounts, plane tickets,
social security, etc. Furthermore, it&#8217;s a centralized clearing house for the
the government to spy/black list it&#8217;s citizens. This could very realistically
turn into a massive new form of the no-fly list where individuals will not
know why they&#8217;ve been flagged. We could have thousands of second class
citizens who have no hopes of a better life because they fit a profile. What&#8217;s
worse, it could happen to you (nothing like fear mongering to make a&nbsp;point).</p>
<p>The bill has lots of other nasty provisions that do things like take away
habeus corpus for non-citizens and <span class="caps">SUSPECTED</span> terrorists (technically leeching
someone&#8217;s wifi access is terrorism as it&#8217;s unauthorized computer access which
is classified as computer terrorism). The fact that this was attached to a
spending authorization for the troops is horrible and it <em><span class="caps">MUST</span></em> be stopped.
Call your senators and let them know that you don&#8217;t support this sort of
piggybacking and that the government needs to allow open and public debate on
this issue. It&#8217;s too important to be piggybacked and rammed through in this&nbsp;method.</p>
<p>&#8211;Patrick</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to reiterate that this is being voted on tomorrow! This means that if
you want to speakup you need to do so now. There&#8217;s a website that you can use
to contact your seantor(s). <a href="http://www.unrealid.com">http://www.UnRealID.com</a>. <strong>[Note: The site
seems to be having problems right now. I tried to submit my fax but I got an
error. If it doesn&#8217;t come back up, you might have to call your Senator.]</strong>
Please take the time to speak up about this if you&#8217;re even half as irate as I
am. At the very least, even if you would support the Real <span class="caps">ID</span> Act, at least
tell your Senator(s) that they should <strong>read</strong> a bill before passing it, just
to make sure shenanigans like this don&#8217;t&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&#8217;re interested, here&#8217;s what I wrote to the Washington State&nbsp;Senators.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morning Senators Murray and&nbsp;Cantwell,</p>
<p>I am writing to voice my opposition of the Real <span class="caps">ID</span> Act, which is being voted
on by the Senate on Tuesday, May 10. First of all, I feel that this Act is the
first step leading to a national <span class="caps">ID</span> card system, not unlike that of Soviet
Russia, communist China, and Vietnam. Frankly, if I wanted to live in China, I
would move there. I would like to think that here in the <span class="caps">US</span> we support our
citizens&#8217; right to&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Second of all, because these cards would be the same throughout all 50 states,
and be machine readable, there is nothing preventing companies and individuals
from the private sector from reading the data on these cards and selling
citizens&#8217; personal information to the highest&nbsp;bidder.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is no proof that <span class="caps">ID</span> documents help prevent or deter terrorism.
An <span class="caps">ID</span> document says nothing about evil intent. Forcing our citizens to
document themselves is <span class="caps">NOT</span> a deterrant to terrorism; rather, it is a <span class="caps">VICTORY</span>
for&nbsp;terrorists!</p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, this Act has been tacked on to another bill,
and has not been discussed or debated on the Senate floor. I believe that as
Senators, it is your responsibility to read and understand all bills before
you, and make an informed decision. The fact that the Real <span class="caps">ID</span> Act is
piggybacking on another bill seems to imply that the author did not feel it
could pass on its own merits. Please read and understand the Real <span class="caps">ID</span> Act in
its entirety, and consider the ramifications of passing this&nbsp;bill.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Tyler W.&nbsp;Butler</p>

about some of the advances made in the 90&#8217;s. The 80&#8217;s coverage was pretty
good, and the history of <span class="caps">PARC</span> and even before was excellent, but it abruptly
ended with Windows 95 and <span class="caps">OSX</span>, and left out a lot of the *nix <span class="caps">GUI</span>
&#8220;experiments&#8221; from the mid-90&#8217;s. It really made me want to learn more,

                                    <p>As if we needed any more proof that lightsabers are cool, HowStuffWorks.com
has a story explaining <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/lightsaber.htm">how lightsabers work</a>. It is <strong>hilarious</strong>, and
frighteningly informative, and made my entire day at the office bearable. Here
are some choice quotes from the&nbsp;article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;be sure to handle any active lightsaber with extreme care until you are
completely familiar with its feel and&nbsp;handling.</p>
<p>By using the Force, the wielder can anticipate the path of the blaster bolt
and align the blade with that path prior to the bolt&#8217;s arrival. Using normal
visual tracking to accomplish the same effect can be far more&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p>The risk of personal injury is much higher with a double-bladed lightsaber,
and their practical applications around the home are limited. Therefore, it is
probably best to save your money and stick with the single-blade&nbsp;version.</p>
<p>Although a lightsaber is typically used as a defensive weapon by Jedi
knights, the availability of lightsabers on consumer sites such as eBay is
growing. It is a sad fact of life, but if a Jedi knight falls on hard times,
his lightsaber is one source of quick cash. He can always build another&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>&#8230;many new owners are pleasantly surprised by the many domestic uses of a
lightsaber around the home or&nbsp;office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also some excellent pictures with&nbsp;captions.</p>

                                    <p>I&#8217;m pleased to say that the Hawktour project came away from <span class="caps">IPRO</span> Day with the
website award, and picked up second place in their track. I am really proud of
the team and how they managed to come together even though I abandoned them
half way through this semester. Santhosh did a great job pulling everything
together. Even though we didn&#8217;t win our category, for three semesters we have
been a top-ranked team, and it&#8217;s a source of great personal pride to know that
I was instrumental in getting us&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>But the real boon this semester was to finally beat out our arch-nemesis in
the website category, <a href="http://www.iit.edu/~ipro329s05/"><span class="caps">IPRO</span> 329</a>. They have consistently beat us in the
website category for the past two semesters, even though we have consistently
improved our site and they have done very little, if anything at all, to
theirs. At the beginning of the semester, Satish (the designer of the website
that rocketed us to website stardom three semesters ago) said that it was his
goal to win that category this semester. I am glad he made it happen. Topping
them was an even bigger deal than winning our category. I feel that <span class="caps">IPRO</span> Day
is a bit of a sham anyway. Of course, we&#8217;ll take the awards if they want
to give them to&nbsp;us.</p>

should strive to be as good as we&nbsp;are.</p>

                                    <p>I removed the <a href="http://del.icio.us/">Del.icio.us</a> <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed from the right side of the site
because it was getting too long. If I had <a href="http://del.icio.us/pridkett">as many</a> as <a href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/">Patrick</a>, the
front page would render about a mile long. So I&#8217;m looking for a way to limit
the number of entries in the feed to something more manageable, like 10. I
really only want to share the most recent entries through a feed anyway &#8211;
that&#8217;s what a feed is for! If I want to share <em>everything</em> I&#8217;ll point people
to the site! So if anyone knows how to cut down the number of entries in the
feed, let me&nbsp;know.</p>
