## Overview

tylerbutler.com is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and serves as a playground or sandbox for various
web applications and ideas I am playing around with, along with occasional articles or links.

The site was previously built using [Engineer](/projects/engineer), a static site generator I created.

The complete source code for the site is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tylerbutler/tylerbutler.com-hugo).
