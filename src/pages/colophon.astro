    <h2>Colophon</h2>

    <p>
      This page describes the technical details of how this website is built,
      hosted, and maintained.
    </p>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>
      This website is built with <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a>,
      a modern static site generator that delivers fast, content-focused websites.
      The site uses Astro's content collections for managing articles and projects,
      providing excellent developer experience and performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Styling is handled with plain CSS using modern features like CSS Grid and Flexbox.
      Typography uses fonts from Adobe Fonts (Typekit) including Adelle for body text
      and Advent Pro for headings.
    </p>

    <h3>Hosting & Deployment</h3>
    <p>
      The site is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>
      with automatic deployments from the main branch of the GitHub repository.
      SSL certificates are provided automatically by Netlify.
    </p>

    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>
      The site is optimized for performance with static generation, minimal JavaScript,
      and optimized images. Astro's partial hydration ensures that only necessary
      JavaScript is loaded on each page.
    </p>

    <h3>Content Management</h3>
    <p>
      Articles are written in Markdown with YAML frontmatter and managed through
      Astro's content collections. This provides type safety and excellent developer
      experience while maintaining simplicity.
    </p>

    <h3>Source Code</h3>
