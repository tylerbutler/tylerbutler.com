## Overview

At its core, Engineer is a static website generator. In other words,
Engineer let's you build a website from a bunch of files -- articles written
in [Markdown][], templates, and other stuff -- and outputs *another* bunch
of files -- HTML, mostly -- that you can then copy wherever you want.

But Engineer has some pretty nifty features that you might find
enticing. Learn more about Engineer, including how to install it, at
<https://engineer.readthedocs.org/>, or check out the source at
[github](https://github.com/tylerbutler/engineer).

You can also check out [the source for tylerbutler.com][1] for an example of what an
Engineer-based site looks like under the covers.
