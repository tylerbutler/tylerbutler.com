[Warren Spector on the iPhone][1]:

> It's like the iPhone is working so hard to be my friend it's incapable of
being my co-worker. It's all fun and games when, at times, I want it to be
serious.

Good points all around. If you want to use your phone for doc editing, or come
from a Palm/Windows Mobile background and are used to rich syncing with the
desktop, the iPhone is lacking.

[More on who Spector is][2], for those that don't know. [Deus Ex][3] remains
one of my favorite games of all time.
