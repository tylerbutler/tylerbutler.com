                        <a href="        /2009/05/sharepoint-permissions-cheat-sheet/">SharePoint Permissions &ldquo;Cheat Sheet&rdquo;</a>
                                            </h1>
                </header>
                                    <p>Back when we were building SharePoint 2007, a member of our Program Management
team left Microsoft, and I inherited the permissions-related features for the
then Content Management Server team, which was responsible for all of the web
publishing features in SharePoint. Essentially, this meant that I has to
figure out what the correct set of permission levels were for our features,
and what lists/libraries should have unique (non-inherited)&nbsp;permissions.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve used SharePoint for any length of time, you&#8217;ve no doubt been
frustrated with permissions management. It&#8217;s definitely a sore point.
Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have any magic bullets or golden hammers. When I
started trying to figure everything out so that I could make educated
decisions for our designs, I realized that I needed to write stuff down.
People always asked questions like, “What rights do Designers have by
default?” Sure, you can find out by going to the site itself and checking, but
the <span class="caps">UI</span> isn&#8217;t the easiest to navigate, and oftentimes what you really want to
do is compare multiple permissions levels. “What rights do Designers have that
Contributors don&#8217;t?”, for example. To help keep it all straight in my mind
(and so I could point people to the info rather than answer 100 emails a day
with the same question!), the SharePoint Permissions “Cheat Sheet” was&nbsp;born.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nothing fancy, and it&#8217;s certainly not anything that no one else could
have created. But still, it has proven useful over the past few years. I still
keep a copy of it pinned to my office wall. It&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory. The
first sheet has a table of the default publishing permission levels and what
fine-grain permissions each of them has. The second sheet is just the
descriptions of each of the fine-grain permissions so I didn&#8217;t have to go
hunting through the <span class="caps">UI</span> to find them whenever I was wondering what the
differences were. Finally, the third sheet is a list of “securable objects”
(which what I decided to call a list/library that had broken away permissions
inheritance and was independently secured) and what default groups had what
rights to those locations by default. This was particularly important since in
general, you want to avoid breaking permissions inheritance if you can, and we
wanted to be very deliberate about where we did, and also track them to ensure
they made sense over&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>So how exactly do you use this? Well, it can be a
handy reference as-is, but chances are that you have your own permissions
level or have modified the existing ones to suit your needs, so you can modify
this sheet to reflect your own custom permissions and keep track of
everything. It really is helpful to have a centralized reference of all of the
various permissions levels. If you go through and put in your own levels, you
might realize that there&#8217;s a lot of needless duplication in the custom
permission level you might have created. When it comes to SharePoint
permissions, less is better, so this can be a helpful auditing tool as well as
a&nbsp;reference.</p>
<p><strong>A couple of disclaimers&#8230;</strong> This was created based on the <span class="caps">RTM</span>
version. As far as I know, nothing has been changed in <span class="caps">SP1</span> or <span class="caps">SP2</span> that would
impact it, but I haven&#8217;t been checking to keep it up to date. If you do notice
errors you can let me know and I&#8217;ll try to correct it. Also, this obviously
won&#8217;t take into account any customizations that you may do that would alter
the default permission levels. If you use this for any of the purposes listed
or for additional things, leave a comment! I&#8217;d love to hear how it&#8217;s working
for you and if it&#8217;s been&nbsp;helpful.</p>

                                    <p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of the <a href="http://www.mountain-goats.com">Mountain Goats</a>, then you are in for a real
treat. I&#8217;ve been a huge fan since 2005. I actually heard about them from a
girl I met during my interview with Microsoft while in Seattle. I picked up a
few tracks off of Tallahassee from iTunes, and I&#8217;ve been in love ever since.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Darnielle">John Darnielle</a> is utterly stunning &#8211; the lyrics consistently blow me
away. I mean, it&#8217;s <em>poetry</em>. The fact that it&#8217;s set to music is just icing on
an already orgasmic cake. If there is one musician who deserves comparison to
Dylan &#8211; it&#8217;s Darnielle. Anyway, my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/vandrijevik">Vlad</a> recently discovered them,
and so I thought it time to share the amazingness with the world at&nbsp;large.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you haven&#8217;t tried <a href="http://www.grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a> yet, give it a whirl. The music
selection is surprisingly large, and being able to link friends directly to
songs and embed them on the web is <em>killer</em>. The <span class="caps">UI</span> is a bit weird and awkward
&#8211; but I assume it&#8217;ll evolve over&nbsp;time.</p>
