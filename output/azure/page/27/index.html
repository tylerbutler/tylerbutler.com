pretty ridiculous, in my opinion, but I am anxious to hear how it turns out.
Game hacking has been an interesting (sub)culture, and has provided us with
awesome games, not the least of which is <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/" title="Counter-Strike's official website.">Counter-Strike</a>. Obviously, there
is probably more to the supposed <span class="caps">DMCA</span> &#8220;violations,&#8221; but I daresay it&#8217;s a

I am writing this from the Marriott Courtyard hotel here in Bellevue, <span class="caps">WA</span>. It&#8217;s
probably the nicest hotel I&#8217;ve ever stayed in, and it has decent high-speed
internet service. I left my apartment in Chicago at 4:15 <span class="caps">CST</span>, and the flights
(I was routed through Denver on Frontier) went pretty well. I only had 30
minutes between flights in Denver so I was a little worried that I wouldn&#8217;t
make it, but I ended up having plenty of&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Picking up the rental car and checking into the hotel was a breeze. It was
nice to hear, &#8220;Well, Microsoft has taken care of everything already, Mr.
Butler. Enjoy your stay,&#8221; as they handed me the paperwork. I could get used to
this.&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>I went out and grabbed some lunch, and I plan on driving out to Building 19,
where my interview is, later on this afternoon. I am trying to figure out if
it&#8217;s worth trying to go downtown and do something, but I might just take a
nap. We&#8217;ll see. I also have to go over my interview notes again. Anyway, more&nbsp;later.</p>
<p><strong> 12:06 am <span class="caps">CST</span>, Feb. 11, 2005</strong>
Well, I intended to write more, and I still do, but I have been getting quite
a few questions about my status, especially since I promised to put stuff
here, so here goes. I <strong>did</strong> receive an offer from Microsoft, which I am
currently considering. More info will be coming, especially about the
interview itself and how it went/what I did, but for now: I do have an offer.&nbsp;:-)</p>
<p><strong>3:43 pm <span class="caps">CST</span>, Feb. 14, 2005</strong>
I have officially accepted Microsoft&#8217;s offer, and am aiming for a start date
of March 28th. I suppose it seems kind of fast, but there are benefits to
getting out there soon. Dr. Sun has accepted the news more gracefully than I
had anticipated, so things are looking up. I will be posting my overview of
the interview day itself in a few&nbsp;minutes.</p>

                                    <p>My friend Dan is Jewish, and he was telling me the other day about Yiddish
curses. He had some pretty funny ones, and he managed to find a site or two that listed some more. I don&#8217;t know Yiddish, and I can&#8217;t even pronounce it based on the spelling, so I&#8217;m not going to waste the space of including the
actual Yiddish here. If you actually want the Yiddish, go to the sites listed
at the bottom of the page. Anyway, here are a few of my&nbsp;favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li>All problems I have in my heart, should go to his&nbsp;head.</li>
<li>He should marry the daughter of the Angel of&nbsp;Death.</li>
<li>God should visit upon him the best of the Ten&nbsp;Plagues.</li>
<li>Venereal disease should consume his&nbsp;body.</li>
<li>I should outlive him long enough to bury&nbsp;him.</li>
<li>God should bless him with three people: one should grab him, the second should
stab him and the third should hide&nbsp;him.</li>
<li>He should have a large store, and whatever people ask for he shouldn&#8217;t have,
and what he does have shouldn&#8217;t be&nbsp;requested.</li>
<li>God should bestow him with everything his heart desires, but he should be a
quadriplegic and not be able to use his&nbsp;tongue.</li>
<li>He should be transformed into a chandelier, to hang by day and to burn by&nbsp;night.</li>
<li>May your bones be broken as often as the Ten&nbsp;Commandments.</li>
<li>May you every day eat chopped liver with onions, herring, chicken soup with
matzo balls, carp with horseradish, roast beef with tsimmes (a sweet side
dish), pancakes, and tea with lemon – and may you choke on every&nbsp;bite.</li>

                                    <p>In my line of work, I deal with uppity people every day. When you&#8217;re in the
position to serve people, you will no doubt encounter countless people who
think their problem is more important than everyone else&#8217;s. This is to be
expected. But what really gets me is when some fool appends their official job
title to the end of their email communications, or in a phone conversation,
for the sole purpose of getting better service because they&#8217;re &#8220;important.&#8221; If
anything, it makes me do the exact <em>opposite</em>. If they think they&#8217;re that
important, then screw them. I do not care if you&#8217;re the executive vice consul
presidential aid&#8217;s assistant. You will wait, just like everyone else. Screw
you and your self-important ego. We&#8217;ll see how you talk to me when I&#8217;m a
millionaire at&nbsp;25.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">PS</span>.</strong> Something else that bugs me is people that feel it necessary to include <em>all</em> of their titles in their email signature. This is especially troublesome for students. For example, there was a semester when I could have signed all my emails like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>Tyler Butler<br />
President, Delta Tau Delta, Gamma Beta Chapter<br />
President, Keygrips Films<br />
Technical Manager, <span class="caps">OTS</span> Support Desk<br />
Team Lead, <span class="caps">IPRO</span> 305, HawkTour&nbsp;Project</p>
<p>Now really&#8230; for any given email, only <strong>one</strong> title makes sense. I don&#8217;t
need to notify the world that I am involved in lots of different things. If I
write an email where a title the pertains to me is relevant, then I&#8217;ll include
it. Otherwise, I&#8217;ll let my actions, not my titles, speak for&nbsp;me.</p>

                                    <p>This past week at work I have been working on using Adobe Acrobat to submit
form data. The value of this is that the form data can be reimported into the
<span class="caps">PDF</span> form then printed all purty-lookin&#8217;. Anyway, Acrobat allows you to submit
your form data in several different formats. One, <span class="caps">FDF</span>, is usable in <span class="caps">PHP</span>
provided you load this module thingy. Unfortunately, the server I want to run
the <span class="caps">PHP</span> script on uses Irix and the module is unavailable for Irix.&nbsp;Poo.</p>
<p>I then turned to <span class="caps">XFDF</span>, which is essentially <span class="caps">FDF</span> data all <span class="caps">XML</span>-ified. <span class="caps">PHP</span> has an
<span class="caps">XML</span> parser built in, so I don&#8217;t have to load any crazy modules to parse the
data. Unfortunately, <span class="caps">PHP</span>&#8217;s parser is <span class="caps">SAX</span>-based rather than <span class="caps">DOM</span>-based, so it
took me a rather long time to figure out how to get it working right. Anyway,
here&#8217;s the <span class="caps">PHP</span> code that essentially takes <span class="caps">XFDF</span> data (declare <code>$file</code> as a
string pointing to the location of your <span class="caps">XFDF</span> file) and parses it into an
associative array (<code>$values</code>). The array is indexed by the <span class="caps">XFDF</span> field names.
The code below is not entirely complete since I snipped it out of a larger
file, but if you look at it, I think you&#8217;ll get the idea. It&#8217;s pretty simple
once you figure out the way <span class="caps">PHP</span> does <span class="caps">XML</span>&nbsp;processing.</p>
