                                    <p><strong>Chapter 18:&nbsp;Memory </strong></p>
<p>“Joel?” He opened his eyes slowly, allowing them to adjust to the bright
light that now shone into his room. His mother&#8217;s concerned eyes stared down at
him, his father smiled grimly from the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s good to see you awake, son,” his father said, walking over and placing
a hand on his shoulder as his mother buried her teary face in his&nbsp;chest.</p>
<p>“Mom, I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span>&#8230;” he protested. Why did she always have to worry so&nbsp;much?</p>
<p>“I know, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m crying.” He rolled his eyes. His mother slowly tore
herself away from him, content eventually to hold his&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>“When we didn&#8217;t hear from you, we started to worry,” his dad began. “But we
figured you were tired and forgot to call or something. Then the police
called, and we tried to get down here as fast as we could, but you were in
surgery, and even after that the police wouldn&#8217;t let us get in here until
they&#8217;d had a chance to talk to you. What did they want to know,&nbsp;anyway?”</p>
<p>“Just what happened, that&#8217;s all,” Joel answered, staring up at the white&nbsp;ceiling.</p>
<p>“Well, we&#8217;re just glad that you&#8217;re all right,” his mom&nbsp;interjected.</p>
<p>“I am, mom, I am.” He patted her hand in&nbsp;reassurance.</p>
<p>“Well, how was the return trip? We read all your letters. Sounds like you
had a great&nbsp;time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the trip back was pretty uneventful. It was sort of sad, really. I
mean, I was excited to be coming back here, you know, but I sort of felt like
I was leaving home, too. It was very&nbsp;strange.”</p>
<p>“Well, son you were there for almost 6 months. I suppose that place is a
part of you&nbsp;now.”</p>
<p>Joel smiled at his father&#8217;s phrasing. It was a little melodramatic, to be
sure, but he did like the sound of it, and in truth, it wasn&#8217;t that far off
the mark. The culture he&#8217;d experienced there, the people, the way the people
there had approached life &#8211; it was all a part of him. It was something that
he&#8217;d nev er forget, something that would shape all of his decisions and
thoughts from now&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess if you&#8217;ve read my letters, then there&#8217;s not a whole lot left
to&nbsp;tell&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Oh, nonsense! We have plenty of questions! Do you feel up to&nbsp;talking?”</p>
<p>Joel smiled. If there was one thing he felt like doing, it was talking. It
was nice to revel in their interest for awhile, to explain the experiences
which had changed him so much, and the pain was bearable now, so he should
make the best of the&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<p>His father pulled up a chair and sat, and Joel told them about his trip from
start to finish, making embellishments here and there for dramatic effect.
They were a captive audience &#8211; neither of them had nev er traveled outside the
state, let alone the country &#8211; and Joel did his best to explain the paramount
differences in culture and world-view that he had experienced on his trip, and
what he had felt he&nbsp;learned.</p>
<p>None of the trio noticed when Ames and Cobb entered the&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>“So Sean pauses, for effect, you know, then says, ‘A date with Natalie Port
man.&#8217; That&#8217;s all he wanted!” His parents broke out in appreciative chuckles.
“So after we all got done&nbsp;laughing&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Excuse me Mr. Mendocino,” Ames broke in, clearing his throat to get their
attention. Joel looked up at him. What did they&nbsp;want?</p>
<p>“Hi detective. What can I do for&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>The two detectives strode in, dragging chairs from the small table in the
corner and sat down around his bed. They had been traveling around for most of
the day, talking to every homeless man they could find in an effort to figure
out who was responsible for Darryl&#8217;s&nbsp;murder.</p>
<p>What they had been told baffled them. The homeless men had told them all the
same story &#8211; some mysterious disappearances had occurred, people would wind up
beaten up, but wouldn&#8217;t say anything more about it. No one they&#8217;d spoken to
knew Darryl personally, so they said, but both Ames and Cobb had gotten the
feeling that some of them were holding back, especially a grizzled man down on
59 th&nbsp;.</p>
<p>They had checked some records back at the station and at local hospitals,
and had found several unsolved crimes the past few mont hs, all involving
homeless people. Nearly 100% of the cases they had found involved&nbsp;men.</p>
<p>None of the homeless had pressed charges, of course, and were tight-lipped
about what had happened, so the cases were closed and no one took a second
look. But Ames and Cobb agreed &#8211; there was a pattern&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>It was still a long shot to tie Darryl into the whole scheme. By most
accounts, he had been abducted, but none of the other abductees had been
killed, and it was still a distinct possibility that his death was just
random. But in the end, Cobb and Ames agreed that their instincts needed to be
trusted, especially this early in the investigation, and their instincts said
that there was something behind all of this &#8211; something sinister, something
that needed to be stopped, and behind it all, there was a case that could make
their&nbsp;careers.</p>
<p>Bereft of clues, they decided to go back to the source, to the only witness
to the crime, even though he hadn&#8217;t been able to tell them anything useful on
their first visit. Perhaps he&#8217;d remember more&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Mendocino, we&#8217;re hoping you can give us some more information.
You see, we&#8217;ve been around talking to a lot of homeless people today, and
they&#8217;ve given us some leads, but we really need a description of your&nbsp;assailants.</p>
<p>“Admittedly, this is a long shot, but we think the men who killed Darryl –
that was the name of the homeless man we found with you &#8211; and shot you are
possibly connected to a lot other violent crime, especially among the
homeless. Obviously, if these guys have escalated to m ur der and have a
history of violence, we&#8217;re probably going to see a lot more needless deaths if
we don&#8217;t find them&nbsp;soon.”</p>
<p>Joel protested, “Well, I already told you what I know&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what
else you want me to try and remember. I didn&#8217;t really get a good look at
them&#8230;” This wasn&#8217;t entirely true. In fact, Joel had gotten a solid look at
their faces, but he hadn&#8217;t been paying attention. After all, they were
pointing a gun at him. He wasn&#8217;t making mental notes about their shoe size or
the number of freckles on their faces at that&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>His mother joined in the protest. “Detectives, my son just got shot! Can&#8217;t
you give him a little time to recover before you come in here barraging him
with questions and&nbsp;making&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Monica,” Joel&#8217;s father interrupted. “They&#8217;re just trying to find the men
that did this. Joel can say no if he wants to. It&#8217;s his&nbsp;decision.”</p>
<p>Ames continued. “Well, what we&#8217;d like to do, Joel, if I may call you that,
is just have you relax and concentrate on the experience as you think back on
it. We&#8217;ve found that many times, if you just relax and focus on a single
element of your memory, you can recall things that you forgot or didn&#8217;t even
fully realize&nbsp;before.”</p>
<p>Joel nodded. He wasn&#8217;t terrible keen on trying to think back on the
experience of getting shot, but if it would help the detectives find the men
and possibly save someone else, then it would be worth his&nbsp;discomfort.</p>
<p>Ames motioned outside Joel&#8217;s door, where a young woman stood with a large
sketch pad and an assortment of pencils in her&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p>“Joel, this is Karen, one of the artists on our staff down at the station.
She&#8217;s just going to try and draw some sketches based on the descriptions that
you can give us. Don&#8217;t worry about her. Just close your eyes and ell us what
you can. We&#8217;ll do the&nbsp;rest.”</p>
<p>Joel laid back against the pillow and shut his eyes as Karen moved yet
another chair into the cramped suite and sat down, pencil at the&nbsp;ready.</p>
<p>He thought back to the delicious taste of the bagel on his tongue, the feel
of the concrete and loose gravel as it crunched under his feet, and the
feeling of sudden isolation he felt upon discovering he was&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>He was standing in the empty alien alley again, turning round and round,
looking for signs of familiarity, but he found&nbsp;none.</p>
<p>“I was in this alley that I&#8217;d nev er been in before &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know where I&nbsp;was.”</p>
<p>Bang! There it was &#8211; the shot! But was it a shot, or just a firecracker, or
a car&nbsp;misfiring?</p>
<p>“I heard a loud shot, but I didn&#8217;t know what it&nbsp;was.”</p>
<p>Then he was running, running, running towards the shot. Why was he running
towards it? Why not away? His actions made no sense. He tried to force his
body to turn, to stop, to at least slow, but he ran&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>There were voices now&#8230; what had they&nbsp;said?</p>
<p>“I heard them talking before I got there. One of them was yelling at the
other for pulling the trigger and shooting the man, and he was saying he
didn&#8217;t do it on&nbsp;purpose.”</p>
<p>He rounded the corner &#8211; there they were, looking down at the dumpster, where
the shot man was lying, his body obscured from Joel&#8217;s view by the&nbsp;dumpster.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, I see them now. They&#8217;re looking down at the man, but they don&#8217;t see me
yet. The man with the gun is average height and build, dark brown hair,
leather jacket, stubble on his face. The other man is a little shorter, say 5&#8217;
5” or so, with blonde hair, clean shaven, and a light black windbreaker. Both
of them are wearing&nbsp;jeans.”</p>
<p>Ames glanced at Karen, then at Cobb. This description was so generic it&#8217;d be
impossible to get Karen to create a useful drawing from it. Yet another dead&nbsp;end&#8230;</p>
<p>They turned and spotted him. He felt a strange, uncontrollable sense of
fear. The gun was pointed directly at him. The man was saying&nbsp;something&#8230;</p>
<p>“Joel,” Cobb broke in. “Can you see any distinguishing features on either of
the men? Something bout the way they walk, or a scar, or&nbsp;something?”</p>
<p>“No, no, don&#8217;t shoot&#8230;” A sweat broke out on his brow and he shook his head
from side to side on the pillow, eyes still clenched&nbsp;shut.</p>
<p>“ Cal m down Joel, it&#8217;s all right,” Cobb continued. “Concentrate &#8211; is there
anything that stands out in your&nbsp;mind?”</p>
<p>Joel let out a gasp, then a low moan, then went limp on the bed. He was
lying on the sidewalk, reeling in agony; his insides felt as though they&#8217;d
been ripped apart. He looked up at the men as they t ur ned away, vaguely
aware of Cobb&#8217;s voice trickling down from the&nbsp;heavens.</p>
<p>Then, a sudden point of clarity &#8211; there, on the shooter&#8217;s hand, a mark. As
they turned and ran, Joel willed himself to focus on that mark. Time slowed
down; he stepped frame by frame through the scene, and zoomed in on the mark,
bringing it into better focus. Then, suddenly, it was gone, and he was falling
endlessly&nbsp;again.</p>
<hr />
<p>He awoke a few minutes later, amidst confused chatter and argument from his
parents, the detectives, and Heather, who had come in after hearing the&nbsp;commotion.</p>
<p>“Give me the paper,” Joel said. No response. “Give me the paper!” he said
again, finally getting the attention of the others in the room. There was a
moment of stunned silence, then Karen thrust her pad and pencil at him. She
held the pad for him while he awkwardly sketched the mark he had seen on the
page as best he&nbsp;could.</p>
<p>He finished it, and handed the pencil back to Karen. “That mark was tattooed
on the right hand of the shooter, between the thumb and forefinger. Now <em>that
</em> is all I can remember.” He sunk back into the bed &#8211; he wanted peace, quiet,
and&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p>Cobb and Ames looked at the picture, than at each other. Now <em>this</em> was
something they could work&nbsp;with.</p>

<p>Ernie was stuffed. He and Ken pushed away from the table, entirely satisfied
with the hearty meal that Rhonda and the other St. Ives volunteers had
provided them. The dining hall, which had been silent during the meal as
groups of hungry homeless dug in to their meals, was now home to a healthy din
of activity, as well-fed men and women chatted, discussed, and&nbsp;joked.</p>
<p>Rhonda and her staff bustled around the hall, stopping occasionally to say
hello to someone they hadn&#8217;t seen in a long time, or to welcome someone new
and make sure they felt welcome to come and dine at St. Ives any&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Rhonda was particularly busy. The unseasonably warm weather
had brought visitors from all over. When the weather was warm, people tended
to get out and walk further, so the dining hall was bursting at the seams with
hungry mouths. She ran back and forth from the kitchen, stopping every once in
awhile to greet some of the visitors personally and introduce herself
personally. She wore a big friendly smile on her face, and despite her
business, always gave each individual her full attention while she talked with&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ernie and Ken were seated a smaller table in the corner of the room right
next to the kitchen door, where they observed the other diners with passive
interest. Ernie didn&#8217;t recognize many of the people there today. They were
probably from the west side, and were only able to make it to St. Ives today
because of the&nbsp;weather.</p>
<p>He had overheard a couple of conversations, while he and Ken ate their soup
quietly, about Darryl. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to hear familiar names, especially
after someone got arrested, hurt, or killed, particularly amongst residents or
frequent visitors to St.&nbsp;Ives.</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t gotten any more information about exactly what had happened to
Darryl, but there had been quite a bit of talk about the mysterious
disappearances of people the past few weeks, and their reappearance with fresh
cuts and bruises. The general consensus among those Ernie overheard was that
Darryl had gotten “abducted” as well, except this time, he&#8217;d wound up&nbsp;dead.</p>
<p>Ernie and Ken relaxed at their table once the meal was complete, waiting for
the dining room to clear out somewhat. It was just as well; their bellies were
so overstuffed with Rhonda&#8217;s hearty soup that they could barely&nbsp;move.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for the crowd to leave the dining hall after lunch was
complete. It was a warm day, after all; a day that would best be spent working
their corner or block, making the most of the warmth. It was __ a day to
be spent inside, warming oneself in the heated interior of the&nbsp;shelter.</p>
<p>Ken, who&#8217;d been keeping a watchful eye on the clock that peered down across
the dining hall, motioned to Ernie that they should get going. They had a few
minutes to walk back to Dominick&#8217;s and meet Holly there. Neither Ken nor Ernie
really knew what to expect from their journey to 59 th Street , but Holly
seemed to think that someone there would know something, and it made sense to
follow her lead. Ernie&#8217;s presence with them would increase their credibility
anyhow, and they&#8217;d be more likely to get the information they were&nbsp;seeking.</p>
<p>Ken&#8217;s zeal for the investigative arts had cooled somewhat. He had come to
the conclusion, after they were unable to gain access to the hospital, that
the life of a true investigator was nothing like that in his books, and that
he&#8217;d be better off finding another occupation. He had, however, dragged Ernie
along on this whole escapade, and felt somewhat responsible to see it through
to its conclusion. Besides, if they did by some miracle manage to find out
what happened to Darryl&#8230; well, <em>that</em> would be cool. His friends on the
corner would <em>definitely</em> give him mad props for&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>They stood up from the table and waved at Rhonda in the kitchen, then headed
out of St. Ives towards&nbsp;Dominick&#8217;s.</p>
<hr />
<p>The hours between Ernie and Ken&#8217;s initial visit and three seemed to stretch
on forever as Holly and Ned rang up customer after customer. Ned was moving a
little more slowly than usual; his mind was on other things. He worried about
Holly. She had put on a brave face when they had come back into the store, but
inside he knew she wasn&#8217;t doing so well. He had seen her talking at length
with Darryl after work in the parking lot; they had talked about life, love,
the pursuit of happiness, and everything else under the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>It continued to amaze him how easily Holly spoke to everyone, especially the
homeless. Her natural listening ear combined with Darryl&#8217;s love to speak had
naturally drawn them to each other. Ned had not been privy to many of their
conversations, but he knew that to Holly, Darryl was a special friend &#8211; she
would miss&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch for what seemed like the millionth time. Only a few
minutes had passed, but three o&#8217;clock was almost upon them. He flipped the
light on his register, signaling that he was now&nbsp;closed.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry,” he said to the confused customers still in his line. “I&#8217;ll
finish up with whoever&#8217;s in my line right now, I&#8217;m just not going to be taking
any new customers.” He smiled reassuringly back at them, and finished checking
out the final customer in record&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Holly was already headed back towards he back of the store to punch out, so
he quickly double-checked his register and followed her blonde head back to
the time-card&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>They remained silent as they walked together to the front of the store and
pushed through the revolving door into the glaring mid-afternoon sun. Ernie
and Ken were just walking into the parking lot, and the four of them
rendezvoused in the middle of the nearly deserted&nbsp;lot.</p>
<p>Ernie still wasn&#8217;t his usual active self, Holly noticed, but the lunch had
done him good; at least he didn&#8217;t look so peaked &#8211; just sad. His headphone&#8217;s
still hung around his neck uselessly, which was unusual and ind icated that
perhaps he had been taking this harder than she had initially thought. Well,
hopefully the guys at 59 th street would be able to shed some light on the
whole situation and give them all a little bit of&nbsp;closure.</p>
<p>Ned was glad that he&#8217;d driven the van today. Normal ly he drove an old,
barely running Volkswagen Jetta, but it had not been cooperating this morning,
so Lavina had offered to take the bus to her job across town, so Ned could
take the van. The van would easily accommodate all four of the travelers; the
Jetta would have been quit a&nbsp;squeeze.</p>
<p>Everyone piled in, Ned driving, Holly in the passenger seat, and Ken and
Ernie in the back, staring silently out the window as they pulled out of the
parking lot. The trip to 59 th was not far, and traffic was light at this
point in the afternoon, so they arrived at the underpass within a few&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>Ned pulled over to the right and turned on his emergency fla shers. There
was nowhere to park in this area, but he hoped they wouldn&#8217;t be staying long;
though Holly knew several of the people here, and Ernie was no doubt a
familiar face to most, he still felt uncomfortable. He didn&#8217;t readily admit
it, especially to Holly, but the grubby faces with their piercing eyes and
wary stares, the dirty, worn corduroys, jeans, and jackets, and the makeshift
dwellings made of cardboard and newspaper &#8211; all of it made him very&nbsp;uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He stuck close to Holly as she moved confidently through the individual
dwellings under the bridge, Ernie and Ken trailing a short distance behind.
She stopped several times to speak with people she recognized, but moved on
after determining that the person knew nothing about&nbsp;Darryl.</p>
<p>They milled about for around 20 minutes, Holly growing more and more
impatient as they walked. No one knew anything &#8211; or if they did, they weren&#8217;t
telling her. As they passed by the dark recesses of a drain pipe along the
lower end of the slope, a low, rich voice called out&nbsp;softly.</p>
<p>“Hey.” Holly turned, peering in the direction from which the voice had come.
She saw nothing. “Down here, in the pipe.” Looking down she saw the
silhouetted outline of a man lying inside the large pipe, a thin blanket
wrapped around&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>“As long as the water ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217;, there&#8217;s not a better bed for miles,” he
said, referring to the pipe in which he laid. “I hear you guys are lookin&#8217; for&nbsp;Darryl.”</p>
<p>Holly stepped closer to the man, who pulled himself out of the pipe and
stood to greet&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>“Well, not exactly&#8230; Darryl&#8217;s dead&#8230;” Holly said softly, looking down at
her feet as she&nbsp;spoke.</p>
<p>“Oh, I know,” the man responded. “My name&#8217;s James. We&#8217;se quite a pair, me
and him. Used to share everything we made, everything we had. We were good
friends. So if there&#8217;s somethin&#8217; you want to know about him, I&#8217;m your man.” He
thrust his hand out at Holly, who took it and shook it firmly. Ned followed&nbsp;suit.</p>
<p>“Well, it ain&#8217;t much,” James said, motioning at the concrete slope alongside
the drain pipe. “But have a seat&#8230; let&#8217;s talk about&nbsp;Darryl.”</p>

                                    <p>The scene faded out, movie like, and Joel was once again in the hospital.
His body ached, but at least the sharp pain had dulled. <em>It must have been a
dream</em>, he thought. A dream based on the memory of that tremendous night the
three of them had shared. The following day he had said goodbye to both Pang
and Sean, and had continued on his trip alone. He had taken Sean&#8217;s thoughts to
heart, and had made a concerted effort throughout the rest of his trip to just
sit back and take it all in; to fully absorb the experience and make it his.
His only regret had been that Sean hadn&#8217;t made the comment&nbsp;earlier.</p>
<p>But now, laying in the hospital bed, staring up at the ceiling, he wondered
if Sean had been right. He didn&#8217;t feel like he had a lot of time. He had been
<em>shot</em>! He felt robbed. This was supposed to be his triumphant return. He had
learned so much, and now he was to apply it to his life, to make sense of
everything, and to make things <em>better</em>. But instead some idiot had shot him,
for no apparent reason, and he was laying in a hospital, probably barely
clinging to his&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>It seemed ludicrous. Fate had such a twisted sense of humor. He had gone so
far, learned so much, only to be idle again, his brain left to stew and figure
out ways to defeat&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>Heather appeared in the doorway again, looking as angelic as she had before.
At least it wasn&#8217;t <em>all</em> bad around&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>“Hi again, Joel. Feeling all right?” she asked softly, sitting down in the
chair next to his bed. He looked over at her and smiled&nbsp;weakly.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>.”</p>
<p>She smiled back. “Well, there are a couple of detectives here that would
like to talk to you if you&#8217;re feeling up to it. They&#8217;re trying to figure out
what&nbsp;happened.”</p>
<p>Joel nodded.&nbsp;“<span class="caps">OK</span>.”</p>
<p>Heather stood up and signaled to the two men waiting outside, then moved to
the back of the room as they&nbsp;entered.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon, Mr. Mendocino, I&#8217;m Detective Cobb, and this is my partner,
Detective Ames. We know you need to rest, but it would really help us out if
you could tell us what&nbsp;happened.”</p>
<p>Joel closed his eyes and thought back to the plane, to the train ride, to
the bagel, and to the altercation in the alley &#8211; all of the events that had
happened since his return. His thoughts were muddy, everything seemed to run&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>“I was walking to my apartment&#8230;” he began. “I had gotten off the train,
and had stopped by Dominick&#8217;s to get something to&nbsp;eat.”</p>
<p>Ames interrupted, “We found you a few blocks east of your apartment? How did
you wind up&nbsp;there?”</p>
<p>Joel furrowed his brow, trying to remember exactly what had happened. “I
don&#8217;t know,” he responded. “I wasn&#8217;t really paying attention. I was pretty
tired and wasn&#8217;t concentrating. I remember hearing a loud bang and running
towards it&#8230; there were two men there, and one of them had a gun. I pleaded
with them, but they were crazy. The guy with the gun just shot me for no
reason, then they ran&nbsp;off.”</p>
<p>“I didn&#8217;t see the other guy on the ground until after I got shot. I picked
him up and tried to walk to the street, but I don&#8217;t know how far I made it.
That&#8217;s all I remember.” He laid back against the pillow. The pain was growing&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Did you know the other man?” Cobb asked, taking notes on a small&nbsp;notepad.</p>
<p>“No. Is he&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>?”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, he was dead when we found you. From what the doctor tells
me, you barely made it&nbsp;yourself.”</p>
<p>Joel groaned. The pain was becoming unbearable again. “I think that&#8217;s enough
for now, Detectives,” Heather spoke up as she moved towards Joel&#8217;s bedside&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Cobb nodded. “<span class="caps">OK</span>, Mr. Mendocino. Thanks a lot for your help. We&#8217;ll let you
know if we find anything.” The detectives turned and exited, and Joel
floundered, feeling for the plunger that would bring him relief. Heather
placed it back in his hand and he pressed it, feeling the relaxing drug flow
wonderfully through him&nbsp;again.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 16:&nbsp;Angelo</strong></p>
<p><em>Breakin&#8217; the law, breakin&#8217; the&nbsp;law&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>Breakin&#8217; the law, breakin&#8217; the law&#8230;</em> Mike sang along with the Judas
Priest song blaring on the radio as he hurtled down the highway at high speed,
weaving in and out of traffic, using the shoulder as his own private lane. He
felt __. In fact, he felt invincible! He was going to go to Angelo&#8217;s
seedy “office,” explain the situation to him, and if he didn&#8217;t understand,
then tough&nbsp;shit.</p>
<p>He was sick of taking it up the ass from everyone. Bill at work, Marie at
home, and Angelo&#8230; he was sick of it. It was going to stop today &#8211; <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>He abruptly noticed his exit on the left and swung the wheel dramatically,
cutting across the four lanes of traffic that separated him and the exit, and
laughed aloud as the cars behind him slammed on their brakes and their horns.
He was in control &#8211; everyone else still worried about their cars, their jobs,
their <em>lives</em>, but he was free. He didn&#8217;t care about any of it anymore, and
<em>that</em> made him&nbsp;powerful.</p>
<p>He careened toward the old warehouse that Angelo called his office, just
east of the highway, in a part of town that was about as far from ritzy as you
could get. Mike didn&#8217;t know exactly which arm of the underworld Angelo worked
for, but he knew he wasn&#8217;t all that powerful. If he had been, Mike would never
had seen him &#8211; he would be protected behind other, more expendable&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p>Angelo was not to be underestimated, though. He had quite a temper, despite
his cold, calculating persona, and enough goons under his control that Mike
knew it would be suicidal to approach Angelo violently. That wasn&#8217;t his goal,
at least at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>He parked the oversized <span class="caps">SUV</span> in the empty lot across from Angelo&#8217;s abandoned
warehouse, wondering as he stepped out of the vehicle just <em>how</em> Marie had
managed to talk him into buying something so obviously out of place in a city.
He locked the door remotely, a happy beep-beep confirming the vehicle&#8217;s
supposed security as he stepped towards the warehouse&nbsp;entrance.</p>
<p>He looked at the dilapidated brick and faded signs posted on the outside of
the warehouse. Angelo really didn&#8217;t keep his place in very good condition,
considering his annual income &#8211; all tax-free, Mike noted. It really wasn&#8217;t a
bad deal, if you could handle the constant worry of law enforcement and the
threat of prison. Not a bad deal at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Mike pounded on the door with his fist, then stepped away, anticipating the
burly guard who swung the door open and inquired in a gruff voice. “Whaddya&nbsp;want?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m here to see Angelo about a payment,” Mike replied, brushing past the
guard as he spoke. The door closed behind him, and the small sliver of
sunlight disappeared. Mike stopped, waiting for his eyes to adjust to the
dimly lit interior of the&nbsp;warehouse.</p>
<p>European techno-pop blasted from a deceptively small boom box in the corner,
where a group of card players seated around a table ignored his entrance
completely, engrossed in their own game of&nbsp;chance.</p>
<p>On his left, a group of shady-looking characters stood next to a makeshift
bar constructed of stacked crates and other miscellaneous junk; they regarded
him with little interest as he walked on down towards Angelo&#8217;s main place of
business in the back of the warehouse, maneuvering around crates of random
items as he&nbsp;went.</p>
<p>The guard who&#8217;d granted him passage trailed behind him, monitoring his
travel and ensuring he didn&#8217;t deviate from his stated purpose of visiting&nbsp;Angelo.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the door to what had been the warehouse&#8217;s small records
office, he knocked quickly three times and twisted the doorknob, not waiting
for the invitation to enter. There Angelo sat before him on the small love
seat facing the door, three rather long lines of cocaine laid out on the low
coffee table in front of him. A thin waif sat next to him, rouge and blush
smeared clumsily on her once-attractive&nbsp;face.</p>
<p>Angelo looked up from the table, and seeing Mike, broke into a smile.
“Mike!” he stood, opening his arms in welcome. “You know, I was just thinking
about you. Here, here&#8230;” He motioned at the table in front of him. “Join me,
there&#8217;s plenty for&nbsp;everyone.”</p>
<p>The girl bent down and inhaled one of the lines, whimpering softly upon its
completion, then laid back in the love seat, bringing her hand to her nose as
her pupils dilated and the stimulant began to take&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>“No thanks,&nbsp;Angelo.”</p>
<p>“No? Well, more for me, I suppose.” He sat down and promptly inhaled both
remaining lines, one in the left nostril and the other in the right, shaking
his head hard when he was done. He looked up at Mike again, his nose bright
red and an unfocused look in his&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, where is&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t have it,” Mike stated&nbsp;calmly.</p>
<p>Angelo raised his eyebrows. “You don&#8217;t have&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p>Mike nodded. “I don&#8217;t have&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>Angelo stood again and approached Mike slowly. His five-foot-three frame was
dwarfed next to Mike&#8217;s, but the maniacal gleam in his eyes indicated to Mike
that he meant business. Mike stood his&nbsp;ground.</p>
<p>“Mike, your debt isn&#8217;t due until the end of the month, but you know the&nbsp;rules.”</p>
<p>Mike did know the rules, but he knew that that wouldn&#8217;t stop Angelo from
reminding him of them now. Angelo seemed to take special pleasure in reminding
people of the rules after they&#8217;d already been&nbsp;broken.</p>
<p>“The only reason you come to visit me unannounced is to pay off a debt.
Anything else, you call me and I <em>invite</em> you here or we deal with it over
the phone. You know how it works.” The girl on the couch looked up at them
both and giggled, giddy with the coke and tension in the&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>“Shut up, bitch!” Angelo turned and yelled at her, causing the smile to melt
right off her face. He turned back to&nbsp;Mike</p>
<p>Mike nodded. “I know, Angelo, but I wanted to come and tell you in person
that I won&#8217;t be able to pay you back&#8230;&nbsp;ever.”</p>
<p>Angelo raised his eyebrows even higher in disbelief. “Ever?&nbsp;Hmmm&#8230;”</p>
<p>He turned, clasping his hands behind him as he paced slowly in the small
room. “Well, I certainly appreciate the gesture, Mike, but as you know, I
don&#8217;t run that kind of business. Around here, we have strict rules that we
adhere to, and when someone breaks them, they&#8217;re punished. And whether you&#8217;ll
have the money by the time it is due or not is really irrelevant to these
proceedings. You came to visit me uninvited, without payment, which is an
egregious breach of the contract you and I arranged at the time you bet on
that horse. What was it&#8217;s name?” He paused, trying to remember the name, then
resumed his pacing when the name eluded&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Mike became aware of the guard from the entranceway behind him. “Well, it
doesn&#8217;t matter what it&#8217;s name was now, I&nbsp;suppose.”</p>
<p>The guard reached towards Mike&#8217;s arm, but Mike was prepared. He&#8217;d been
waiting for this moment. He sidestepped, grabbing the guards own wrist as he
reached for Mike&#8217;s, and thrust his body against the guards, forcing him off
balance and sent him tumbling towards the cocaine powdered coffee&nbsp;table.</p>
<p>He smashed face first into it, sending shards of imitation wood throughout
the room. The girl screamed and picked her feet off the floor just in time to
avoid getting them smashed by the falling body. Angelo moved towards the
falling twosome, and Mike pushed himself off of the falling body and whirled
around 180 degrees, grasping his hands together as he spun. His two united
fists collided with Angelo&#8217;s cheek as he completed his spin, sending Angelo&nbsp;reeling.</p>
<p>Mike didn&#8217;t skip a beat. He separated his hands and pounced on Angelo while
he was still off balance, pinning him against the wall and grabbing him around
the neck. He was in control, and it felt good. He searched Angelo&#8217;s face for
signs of fear, but there were&nbsp;none.</p>
<p>“You motherfucker,” Angelo squeaked, pushing hard on Mike&#8217;s hands with his
own, trying to release Mike&#8217;s strangle hold, but it was&nbsp;useless.</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t control me, Angelo!” Mike yelled, squeezing his hands tighter
around the soft flesh of Angelo&#8217;s neck. His face was turning a satisfying
color of red. “I&#8217;m going to fucking kill you, just like I killed that other
fucking&nbsp;prick.”</p>
<p>The feeling of complete supremacy that he&#8217;d had while pounding away on
Marie&#8217;s lover returned. He <em>was</em>&nbsp;invincible.</p>
<p>He felt a sharp pain on the back of his neck and felt his muscles go
suddenly limp, then another strike to the back of his skull brought complete&nbsp;blackness.</p>
<p>Angelo pushed his motionless body off of him, inhaling deeply to regain his
composure. He leaned on Marty, who had come to his rescue from the interior of
the warehouse, catching his breath. He kicked Mike&#8217;s body as hard as he could.
“Who&#8217;s in control now,&nbsp;bitch?”</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 14:&nbsp;Watson</strong></p>
<p>Ernie wasn&#8217;t his usual self. His thoughts had cleared a bit since he had
first set his eyes on Darryl&#8217;s motionless body, but the image kept coming back
to him at inopportune times, sending a shudder through his body each&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Ken was riding alongside him, occasionally breaking off to scout out ahead
in a large circle, then riding back to resume a slower pace beside him. The
both of them were headed to Elston Memorial hospital to see the other guy
who&#8217;d been shot. Ken had said his name was&nbsp;Joel.</p>
<p>Ernie wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in any of this, but Ken seemed excited
about trying to figure out what had happened, and Ernie felt it necessary to
come along, if only to keep Ken company. They had, in the past, kept each
other out of trouble by posing as father and son, or uncle and nephew, or any
one of a number of fictitious relationships that proved advantageous in
certain situations. It had gotten them out of a few scrapes, and rewarded Ken
with a rather large collection of otherwise unattainable mens&#8217;&nbsp;magazines.</p>
<p>Ernie&#8217;s thoughts wandered back to what Darryl had said that day in the
dining hall at St. Ives. He wasn&#8217;t much of an analytical thinker. He knew he
had been frightened at the tone of Darryl&#8217;s voice, and he&#8217;d made it a point to
remember exactly what he&#8217;d said, even though his memory was especially
terrible. But what could the meaning have been? It seemed obvious that
Darryl&#8217;s comments and his death were somehow linked, but how, Ernie didn&#8217;t&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>Ken returned from one of his scouting trips and said hurriedly, “Come on,
Ernie, let&#8217;s <em>go</em>! We&#8217;re almost there.” He motioned to the large riding pegs
mounted on his rear wheel. “Hop on&#8230; it&#8217;ll be&nbsp;faster.”</p>
<p>Ernie grimaced as he stepped up onto the pegs and gripped Ken&#8217;s shoulders
for balance. He hated riding with Ken this way &#8211; he much preferred to walk.
But when Ken was in a hurry, there was no arguing with him, so Ernie held on
tightly and together they zoomed down the shallow hill towards Elston&nbsp;Memorial.</p>
<p>Ken was right; the bike was faster, and the looming multistoried building
that was Elston Memorial was soon upon them. The hospital wasn&#8217;t as busy as
Ken and Ernie had imagined. The parking lot was only half-full, and the
occasional flashing lights and flurry of activity at the emergency room
entrance as an ambulance drove up was the only sign of life in the entire
hospital&nbsp;grounds.</p>
<p>Ken wheeled around the parking lot, weaving between parked cars, and Ernie
held on more tightly. He knew Ken was doing this for his benefit. He&#8217;d have to
get him back later. He had to admit that the wind rushing through his hair
felt nice, though. If he could get the fear of falling off out of his head,
riding with Ken might actually be <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>Ken pulled to a stop in front of the main entrance and pulled his chain lock
around the front tire, locking it securely. Together he and Ernie walked into
the&nbsp;hospital.</p>
<p>Ernie wasn&#8217;t exactly sure what Ken&#8217;s plan was, but hopefully it&#8217;d be
something they&#8217;d done before. Ernie didn&#8217;t improvise well, but they had a
large enough repertoire of practiced scams that improvisation was rarely&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>They approached the front desk and Ken peered over the counter at the nurse
sitting there. “We&#8217;re here to see Joel Mendocino,” he&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>The nurse looked over at them. “<span class="caps">OK</span>, friends or family?” She addressed the
question to Ernie. Ken interjected, “My uncle&#8217;s deaf; you&#8217;ll have to have me
ask him questions in sign language. But we&#8217;re family. Joel&#8217;s my cousin. We
heard something had happened to him, and that he&#8217;d been taken&nbsp;here.”</p>
<p>Ernie was relieved; no quick thinking would be necessary today. The deaf
uncle role was one with which he was very familiar. Neither he nor Ken really
knew sign language, but they had perfected a series of motions that convinced
most people they were really communicating, and if faced with someone who
actually did know <span class="caps">ASL</span>, they would simply say that Ernie had learned a little
known Eastern European signing style, and leave it at that. It was a simple
scam, but worked amazingly&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>The nurse turned back towards the computer in front of her. “Mendocino, you
say? Hmmm, he&#8217;s still in surgery. He should be out in the next hour or so, but
he&#8217;ll be unconscious for awhile after that. I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t let you see&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Ken frowned. This wasn&#8217;t working out at all like the mystery novels he&#8217;d
been reading. He&#8217;d have to think of something else. Ken motioned at Ernie with
his hands. Ernie responded, waving his hands in a strange wavy&nbsp;arc.</p>
<p>“My uncle wants to know if anyone else in his family has been contacted, or
if anyone else has come to see&nbsp;Joel.”</p>
<p>The nurse examine her monitor again. “Well, it looks like the police have
contacted his parents. They should be here&nbsp;shortly.”</p>
<p>Ken and Ernie exchanged hand motions again. “<span class="caps">OK</span>, thanks a lot miss. You have
a nice day.” The two of them turned and walked out of the hospital back into
the afternoon sun. Ernie suddenly realized he was getting&nbsp;hungry.</p>
<p>Ken seemed to read his mind. “Let&#8217;s get something to eat, Ernie. You think
Rhonda would mind if I ate with you at St. Ives?” Ernie nodded. Unlike the van
Zandt&#8217;s, Rhonda&#8217;s kitchen was open to everyone. Ernie&#8217;s rumbling stomach got
the better of him and he hopped on the back of Ken&#8217;s bike. Ken knew a few
short cuts, which combined with the faster speed of the bike would put them
back at St. Ive&#8217;s in pretty good&nbsp;time.</p>
<hr />
<p>As Ken dodged the large puddles of water behind the Dominick&#8217;s, one of his
favorite shortcuts, Ernie glanced over behind the store, and glimpsed the nice
girl from the store talking with two other strange looking men. He didn&#8217;t
recognize the other man that stood with them, but he was dressed the same way
the girl was, so he probably worked with&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>He tapped on Ken&#8217;s shoulder, signaling him to stop. Ken put on the brakes
and looked over his shoulder. “What is&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p>Ernie motioned towards where the girl and her companions stood talking. The
girl had started to cry and the her apparent coworker was hugging&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Ken knew what Ernie was thinking. He turned the handlebars and wheeled
around the sidewalk towards the back of the store, staying within the bounds
of the alley in order to appear as though the two of them were just innocently
riding by. After they cleared the back wall of the store, he stopped and they
both dismounted. He laid the bike down on the asphalt and together they poked
theirs heads around the wall, peering surreptitiously at the motley group
before&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The two strange looking men turned and walked back towards the store,
forcing both Ken and Ernie to quickly hide their heads back behind the wall to
avoid being seen. After a minute, Ken slowly stuck his head back around and
looked again. The coast was clear this time; the two men were gone, and the
girl stood with her head against her coworker&#8217;s chest, crying&nbsp;quietly.</p>
<p>“Ernie, you know her, right?” Ken turned and looked back at Ernie, who was
still pressed against the wall, eyes closed. “Don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;re gone. I
don&#8217;t think they saw&nbsp;us.”</p>
<p>Ernie opened his eyes and relaxed slightly, then nodded in response to Ken&#8217;s&nbsp;inquiry.</p>
<p>“Well, let&#8217;s go talk to her. I&#8217;m think she knew Darryl.” Ernie nodded again.
He was aware that the girl and Darryl knew each other; in fact, Darryl was
partly responsible for introducing Ernie to her in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Ken picked his bike up off the asphalt and together they rounded the corner
and walked towards the girl and her&nbsp;companion.</p>
<p>Holly noticed them approaching and smiled at Ernie amidst her tears. She
broke from Ned&#8217;s arms and walked over to meet them, a small smile on her face
despite the tears in her eyes. “Hi, Ernie,” she said, wrapping her arms around
him in a short&nbsp;embrace.</p>
<p>“Hi&#8230;” Ernie replied softly, willing himself to remember her&nbsp;name.</p>
<p>“Holly,” she smiled as she pulled away from him. She giggled softly, then a
sad looked reappeared on her&nbsp;face.</p>
<p>“Did you hear about Darryl?” she asked. Ernie nodded, sadness enveloping his
face as well. Holly looked down at her feet. “Do you know what&nbsp;happened?”</p>
<p>Ernie nodded again, memories of Darryl&#8217;s face in the ambulance swirling in
his mind once again. They stood in silence for awhile, looking at their feet,
thoughts of Darryl pin balling between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Holly looked up a few minutes later, dried tears on her face, the sign of
deep thought in her eyes. “Do you think maybe some of the guys down at the 59
th Street bridge might know what happened to him?” Ernie looked up at her and
locked his gaze with her clear green eyes. He&nbsp;shrugged.</p>
<p>They looked down at the asphalt again, until Holly turned to Ned, who had
quietly approached from behind them. “What time do you get off work,&nbsp;Ned?”</p>
<p>“Three o&#8217;clock today,” he said, glancing at his&nbsp;watch.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Holly replied. “Fancy a trip down to 59 th Street&nbsp;?”</p>
<p>Ned shrugged. How could he refuse her now, with her tear-stained face and
bright, expectant&nbsp;eyes?</p>
<p>Holly turned back to face Ernie, who was gazing at his feet once again.
“We&#8217;re going to go to 59 th street to talk to some of the guys there at 3
o&#8217;clock, if you want to come, Ernie.” She glanced at Ken to make sure he&#8217;d
heard the time, knowing Ernie wouldn&#8217;t remember it. She looked back at Ned.
“Well, I guess you and I had better get back to&nbsp;work.”</p>
<p>Ernie looked up again and nodded in affirmation before turning slowly and
walking back towards the alley beside the store and the sanctuary of St. Ives.
Holly called over his shoulder at him as Ken walked his bike up alongside&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>“Ernie, I <em>am</em> sorry. I know Darryl was your friend too.” Holly turned and
followed Ned back into the store. Ernie kept walking towards St. Ives, Ken
alongside&nbsp;him.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 15:&nbsp;Awakening</strong></p>
<p>Joel awoke in the hospital, only vaguely remembering how he&#8217;d gotten there.
The circumstances surrounding his arrival at the hospital were not at the
forefront of his mind &#8211; the pain he was in was. His side ached terribly.
Looking down at his torso, he saw the white gauze covering it. He groaned as
his movement shot white hot pain through his entire&nbsp;abdomen.</p>
<p>He rubbed his head and moaned again. His movement seemed to have set off a
chain reaction of pain within his body that now radiated from his stomach
through to the tips of his fingers. The door opened quietly and a strikingly
attractive nurse glided&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>She smiled compassionately down at him and reached down to cover him with
his blanket. He hadn&#8217;t even realized he was so cold, but her firm warm hands
on his body made its uncontrollable shaking that much more&nbsp;apparent.</p>
<p>“Hi, Mr. Mendocino. My name is Heather. It&#8217;s good to see you awake. Try not
to move too much. Your body needs some time to try and recover. I know you&#8217;re
in a lot of pain. We&#8217;ve got you hooked up to a morphine drip, so just push on
this to administer yourself another dose.” She placed a small white cylinder
in his hand and gently wrapped his fingers around&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“Joel&#8230;” he&nbsp;murmured.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Heather&nbsp;replied.</p>
<p>“Joel&#8230;” he swallowed. “ Cal l me&nbsp;Joel.”</p>
<p>Heather smiled. He pushed the small button on the top of the white cylinder
and felt a wonderful warmness spread throughout his body. He relaxed almost
immediately and lay back against the soft pillow. He sighed. Heather&#8217;s smiling
face was the last thing he saw before he drifted off to sleep again, oblivious
to the two men who stood outside his door, arguing with the&nbsp;doctor.</p>
<hr />
<p>“So what do you think,&nbsp;Joel?”</p>
<p>Joel looked around to get his bearings. Where was he? He examined his
surroundings slowly, taking in the dark claustrophobic walls of the building
he was in, the light painting soft silhouettes against the tables and chairs,
the murmur of mouths loosened by too much alcohol. This was the bar that he,
Sean and Pang had gone to the night before Sean headed back to the States. He
remembered&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Sean repeated the question, getting Joel&#8217;s attention.&nbsp;“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Wow Joel, you can be so spacey sometimes!” Sean and Pang both laughed. Joel
chuckled as well. “Come on, what&#8217;s the most important thing you want to do
before you&nbsp;die?”</p>
<p>Joel looked down at his nearly empty cup of beer, now warm. “I don&#8217;t know,”
he said. “There&#8217;s a lot of experiences I want to have, you know? I mean, the
reason I came all the way over here was to try and figure things out, to find
out who I am, to experience parts of the world I&#8217;ve only read about, you
know?” Sean and Pang grinned and nodded in&nbsp;understanding.</p>
<p>“But I feel like I&#8217;ve wound up with more questions than answers. I feel even
more confused than I did when I came. This whole trip has made me realize that
there&#8217;s so many things in the world that I will nev er see, let alone
understand, and how can I have an impact on anything, when the world is so
big, and I understand so little of it.” He became conscious that he was&nbsp;rambling.</p>
<p>“I guess I just feel like it doesn&#8217;t matter what I do in the end, and that&#8217;s
disheartening for me, because I need to feel like what I do matters, that it
has an effect&#8230;” He looked down at his beer again and took the final swig of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“Well, you know&#8230;” Pang began. Sean groaned, rolling his eyes and burying
his head in his hands. “ Cam us might say that life&#8217;s all about amassing
experience, and that it doesn&#8217;t really matter what you do, or what effect you
have, it only matter&#8217;s what experiences&nbsp;you&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Oh come off it, Pang.” Sean interrupted good-naturedly. They all laughed.
Pang had a habit of bringing up literature or philosophy at somewhat random
points in a conversation, and Sean, not being the most scholarly person one
would ever meet, always ended up confused. None of them could deny the simple
facts though; they had all come to Asia by different means, but searching for
the same thing: answers to the big questions, or at least a compass to help
them find the right&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>Joel sighed, peering once again into his now empty glass of beer. “I used to
think I had the world figured out,” he murmured. “I used to think that life
was just a simple equation, and if I could figure out all the variables and
all the constants, I could solve it and be happy. But it&#8217;s not that simple is
it?” It was a rhetorical question, and there was a brief moment of silence
before Sean&nbsp;interjected.</p>
<p>“You two,” he said, shaking his head. “I ask a <em>simple</em> question about what
you guys want to do before you die, and <em>you</em> start talking about literary
themes, and <em>motifs</em>, and all that <em>crap</em>, and <em>you</em> go off on this sad sob
story about how you can&#8217;t figure life out. And to think I came all the way
around the world just to run into two self-indulgent idiots like you&nbsp;guys.”</p>
<p>Pang and Joel exchanged satisfied glances. They enjoyed making Sean&nbsp;squirm.</p>
<p>“Since you guys can&#8217;t give a straight answer, I guess I&#8217;ll have to show you
how it&#8217;s done.” He sat up straight in his chair, pausing for dramatic effect
before continuing. “I would be totally complete, if I could do only one thing
before I die.” He paused again, milking the attention that Pang and Joel were
paying&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>“Just one date with Natalie Port man. That&#8217;s all.” He pushed back from the
table as Pang and Joel burst out in&nbsp;laughter.</p>
<p>“What? I think it&#8217;s a noble pursuit! And trust me, with my charm and good
looks, she&#8217;ll be putty in my hands. <em>Putty! </em>” He nodded&nbsp;confidently.</p>
<p>The other patrons of the bar shot confused glances over at Pang and Joel,
who were laughing raucously, pounding on the table in an effort to rid
themselves of the excess energy the mental image of Sean on a date with
Natalie Portman had given&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Sean pulled his chair back into the table as their laughter died down and
the din of the bar returned to&nbsp;normal.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” Joel asked, eyes still teary from the&nbsp;laughter.</p>
<p>“Hell, yeah! In all honesty, there&#8217;s not much else I want or need right now,&nbsp;really.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, I feel the same way, but aren&#8217;t there things you want to see
and experience while you can? I mean, you&#8217;re the one who asked the stupid&nbsp;question.”</p>
<p>“Yes, there are plenty of things I want to see and experience, but I also
try my hardest not to take for granted what I do have, and what I have been
able to experience. I seriously think you&#8217;re just pining away for things that
you haven&#8217;t had a chance to experience yet. I guess it&#8217;s a cliché, but you
seriously seem to think the grass is greener on the other side, but you
haven&#8217;t even tasted the grass on your side, you&nbsp;know?”</p>
<p>Joe started to interrupt, but Sean held up his&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>“Wait a second. Think about this. You&#8217;re sitting in a bar in Thailand , on a
trip to Asia you saved up for mont hs and mont hs to take, with two random
people you met during your travels, shootin&#8217; the shit, and all you can talk
about is how you&#8217;re worried that you don&#8217;t have it all figured out. Look
outside, man, and remember where you <em>are</em>. Friggin&#8217; just enjoy&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>Joel looked out the open window, where the bustle of the nighttime street
was slowing down gently, and the stars peeked out behind a haze of clouds that
had earlier graced them with a gentle rain. The goofy oaf had a point. He
sighed and let a smirk cross his face. Sean&nbsp;smiled.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;ve got plenty of time to change the world, Joel, if that&#8217;s what you
really want to do. Plenty of&nbsp;time.”</p>

                                    <p>The lights downstairs were all off. The dishes from Mike&#8217;s breakfast earlier
in the morning still sat in the sink; the soft sound of water drops echoed in
the silent twilight of the&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>Mike glanced around expectantly, all five of his sense on maximum awareness,
ready to respond. Someone was in his house &#8211; he could feel it. Someone had the
audacity to enter his home &#8211; <em>his home</em> &#8211; and do something &#8211; what he didn&#8217;t
yet know &#8211; but whatever it was, he knew he wasn&#8217;t going to like&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He stepped quietly to the closet in the den and picked up his trusty
baseball bat. If someone wanted to get physical with him, he was going to have
something other than his fists to protect him. He still had seen no sign of
the intruders, but he knew they were there somewhere, and he was going to
introduce them to Big&nbsp;Bertha.</p>
<p>Now armed with the bat, he moved slowly towards the stairs up to the second
floor of the house. The creaking of the carpeted stairs hid the sounds
floating down from upstairs until he made it to the narrow hall at the top of
the&nbsp;stairs.</p>
<p>Once there, the sound was clearly audible. He turned left towards it, bat
held at the ready, and crept towards the bedroom. The perspiration collected
in large beads along his forehead, then ran down into his eyes. He didn&#8217;t dare
remove his hands from the bat to wipe them, and instead ignored the burning
sensation and slightly blurred vision the saline sweat&nbsp;produced.</p>
<p>He reached the bedroom, the apparent source of the sound. The door was only
partly open, and he sidled alongside the doorway, back pressed against the
wall. He peered inside the crack of the door, but nothing was&nbsp;visible.</p>
<p>The sounds were growing louder. Soft, hushed breathing and occasional low
moans had turned into groans and raspy, labored breaths, coming at a much
greater frequency than before. Mike took a deep breath, gripped the handle of
the bat till his knuckles turned white, turned and stormed into the bedroom,
yelling at top of his&nbsp;lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 12:&nbsp;Identification</strong></p>
<p>“Wow, what a dump,” Cobb said as he stepped into the small one bedroom
apartment. “Not much of a decorator, is he?” The apartment was bare except for
a small unmade bed in the corner. The floor was bare cement, the normally
white walls a light brown from months of city soot and&nbsp;grime.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you get what you pay for,” Ames commented as he moved deeper
into the interior of the apartment. “Doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s a whole lot
here. The landlord did say the kid had been subletting the place, and that the
other two tenants left about a month&nbsp;ago.”</p>
<p>“Two people lived&nbsp;here?”</p>
<p>“Well, not everyone has the benefits of a detective&#8217;s salary, Cobb,” Ames
smiled wryly. Cobb shook his head in response. “Hard to believe, that&#8217;s&nbsp;all.”</p>
<p>He detectives glanced around&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here. Maybe the kid was just coming
back today. He did have those tickets in his&nbsp;backpack.”</p>
<p>“All right. What&nbsp;next?”</p>
<p>Cobb sat down on the bed, looking around the room in thought. “They said the
other guy was most likely homeless, right?” Ames nodded. “Not too unusual in
this part of town. I think there&#8217;s a shelter down on Sullivan. Maybe somebody
there knows the&nbsp;guy.”</p>
<p>“You read my mind. Let&#8217;s go.” He slapped his hands on his thighs and stood
up, following Ames out of the ground floor apartment and back to their car.
“You drive,” he said, throwing Ames the&nbsp;keys.</p>
<p>Ames was surprised. “Say what? You never let me drive? What&#8217;s the&nbsp;deal?”</p>
<p>“I just want to look around a bit. You&nbsp;drive.”</p>
<p>Ames didn&#8217;t argue. Cobb was reticent as he started up the engine and pulled
slowly out of the apartment complex and back onto the main road, making his
way towards Sullivan Street&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Cobb looked out of the passenger side window at the groups of homeless men
and women underneath the bridges as they passed. Their faces were dirty, hair
greasy, a broken, beaten look in their&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>He thought back to the last summer he&#8217;d spent with his mother. He&#8217;d grown up
in a neighborhood not unlike this one. He didn&#8217;t remember exactly how it had
happened, but one day, his mother had come home from work telling him to pack
his things into his small backpack, and they&#8217;d left the apartment that had
been his&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>They had walked forever that day, him with his backpack, his mother with a
small blue suitcase. When evening fell, they had found shelter under a bridge
with others like themselves &#8211; others with nowhere else to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Cobb hadn&#8217;t liked it there at first. The cement was a hard, cold bed, and
the others there had smelled funny, but his mother had held him close, told
him that everything was going to be <span class="caps">OK</span>, and eventually he was able to fall&nbsp;asleep.</p>
<p>Every day they followed the same routine &#8211; they&#8217;d get up, repack their
belongings, and walk around the city streets, looking for whatever they could
find. At first, his mother went into a few places looking for jobs. Cobb would
sit out in front of the store, patiently watching his backpack and the blue
suitcase, but every time his mother returned with a sad look on her face, and
they started walking&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Eventually, his mother stopped looking for jobs and started looking for
food. Cobb was always hungry, and so their lives became a constant search for
sustenance. His mother would take his hand and they&#8217;d walk along the alleys,
looking in dumpsters for food or other things that might prove valuable in
trade to someone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>This had been his life for that summer. Towards the end, his mother had
started leaving him under the bridge in the evening. She would return a few
hours later, often with new bruises, but the next morning, his mother would
pull out a small wad of crumpled cash, and they would go out and have a big
breakfast, with orange juice, eggs, and pancakes, and sometimes, they&#8217;d go to
the carwash and wash themselves with the hose. Those had been his favorite&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>One day a policeman had stopped them on the street and had taken them to the
police station. He had sat on the bench with his mother fearfully clutching
her hand, and had cried incessantly when she said she had to go and he would
have a new family and a new&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Social Services had placed him with a foster family, and he had gone back to
school. The foster family was nice enough, but all he had really wanted was
his mother. He hadn&#8217;t seen her since that day in the police station. He
wondered now, as he peered out on the dirty faces, if perhaps one of them was&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Abruptly, the car turned onto Sullivan Street and Cobb was drawn back into&nbsp;reality.</p>
<p>“There it is, at the corner, on the right,” said Ames quietly as they
approached the St. Ives shelter. Cobb looked up at the large stone structure
looming in front of them. The white brick exterior was worn and caked with
city grime. The large orange neon cross above the entrance flickered “Jesus
Loves You.” A few grubby, coated figures sat on the large stairs, sharing a
cigarette between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ames pulled up next to the entrance and parked the car.&nbsp;“Ready?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, let&#8217;s go.” Cobb pulled his jacket tighter around him as they exited
the car and walked towards the figures sitting on the stairs. They seemed to
have the right idea. He could really use a cigarette right now. He pulled one
from his pocket and lit it as he and Ames took the stairs towards the&nbsp;entrance.</p>
<p>“Better not smoke that inside,” one of the figures on the stairs said as
they passed by. Cobb stopped and turned. “Why&nbsp;not?”</p>
<p>“Rhonda won&#8217;t like it. She doesn&#8217;t let us smoke inside. Why else you think
we&#8217;d be sittin&#8217; out here? Shit, it&#8217;s <em>warm</em> in there.” The man gestured
towards St. Ives. The others sharing the cigarette&nbsp;laughed.</p>
<p>Cobb handed the cigarette to the man. “Well, I guess you guys can have this
one on&nbsp;me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, officer,” the man responded, accepting Cobb&#8217;s&nbsp;offer.</p>
<p>“Is it that obvious?” Cobb asked, putting his hands in his jacket&nbsp;pockets.</p>
<p>“Only cops move the way you two do,” the man responded, inhaling Cobb&#8217;s
cigarette slowly before passing it along to the next one in the small&nbsp;circle.</p>
<p>Cobb smiled. “Must be our police training.” A few men chuckled as he turned
and followed Ames into the large St. Ives&nbsp;vestibule.</p>
<p>“Sounds like Rhonda&#8217;s the one we want to talk to,” said Cobb as they hung
their coats on the rack in the corner. Ames murmured in agreement, and they
walked up the short staircase into the large dining hall. It was mostly empty,
except for one of two men sitting at distant tables,&nbsp;eating.</p>
<p>The only sounds seemed to be coming from a door at the far side of the room,
so they walked in that direction, aware of the strong smell of food wafting
more strongly as they&nbsp;approached.</p>
<p>“They say it&#8217;s warm in here?” Ames commented as they entered the doorway to
the kitchen. “Seems chilly to&nbsp;me.”</p>
<p>“Wal, you try heatin&#8217; a big old place like dis wit what money we got!
‘Sides, it&#8217;s warmer than outside, and that&#8217;s warm enough for most folks here.”
Rhonda turned from the kitchen sink and wiped her hands on her&nbsp;apron.</p>
<p>“Are you Rhonda?” Ames asked, stopping at the entrance to the&nbsp;kitchen.</p>
<p>“Sho ‘nuff,” Rhonda replied. “And you must be cops. Only cops walk the way
you do. What can I do for&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>Cobb interrupted, “Hi Rhonda, I&#8217;m Detective Cobb and this is my partner,
Detective Ames. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard yet, but there were a couple of
men found earlier this morning, and one of them is dead. He appeared to be
homeless, so we were wondering if he&#8217;d have maybe come in here. We&#8217;re just
trying to find out who he is and how he got&nbsp;shot.”</p>
<p>“Shot? Well, dat&#8217;s a new one for one of my guys. Usually they do a pretty
good job of staying out o&#8217; da way of guns. You got a picture?” Ames nodded,
reaching into his jacket pocket for the&nbsp;Polaroid.</p>
<p>“Ma&#8217;am, this is from the crime scene,&nbsp;so&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Just let me see it. I&#8217;ve seen worse, I&#8217;m sure.” Rhonda walked over,
accepted the picture, and inspected it with a frown on her face, shaking her&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this is Darryl. I don&#8217;t know his last name.” She shook her head
again. “Poor guy. Guys around here call him da Squeegee Man, on ‘ccount o&#8217; his
always cleaning car windows down on State Ave. Last time he came in, he was
pretty beat up, but he didn&#8217;t seem to wanna talk about it. We don&#8217;t pressure
‘em ‘round here. He ate a bit, talked to Ernie once, but didn&#8217;t stay the
night. I hadn&#8217;t seem him since den.” She handed the picture back to Ames&nbsp;.</p>
<p>“Do you know anything more about him? Any reason you can think of that he
would have been shot?” Rhonda shook her&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>“No, Darryl was a nice guy, real friendly and he&#8217;d talk your ear off if you
let him. He was different last I saw him, though. Real quiet. Like I said, he
was beat up. I spect he got in front of that bullet by accident &#8211; he wasn&#8217;t
the kind to seek out&nbsp;trouble.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>. You mentioned he talked to Ernie last time he was here. Who&#8217;s&nbsp;Ernie?”</p>
<p>Rhonda smiled. “He&#8217;s a reg&#8217;lar ‘round here. He&#8217;s not all right in the head,
but he&#8217;s a sweet boy. He didn&#8217;t have anything to do with this, I can tell you
dat. He used to talk to Darryl a lot; went out with him to State Ave.&nbsp;once.”</p>
<p>“Any idea where we can find&nbsp;him?”</p>
<p>“Wal, he usually goes down and hangs out with some kids around 34 th and
Broadway, but I doubt you&#8217;ll get much from him. Ernie can&#8217;t describe things
very well. His mind don&#8217;t work dat way. Tell you what, though, there&#8217;s a girl
that some of da guys talk about ‘round here. She works up at the Dominick&#8217;s
just up the street. Da guys say she&#8217;s real nice. I know Darryl knew her; Ernie
does too. She might know somethin&#8217; more. Sometimes dey talk to other people
better &#8211; they don&#8217;t tell me too much. Now, I&#8217;ve gotta get the rest of this
food made, we&#8217;ll be having a large crowd here for lunch in a bit. ‘Scuse me.”
She brushed pas Ames and Cobb and rummaged around the&nbsp;counter.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>. Thanks a lot ma&#8217;am. If you hear anything just give us a call at the
station.” Rhonda nodded, and Cobb turned back and left the kitchen, Ames close&nbsp;behind.</p>
<p>“You want to head over to the Dominick&#8217;s?” Ames&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p>“Might as well. Foster&#8217;s going to call us when the kid wakes up. Might as
well try to figure out why the homeless guy&#8217;s&nbsp;dead.”</p>
<p>Cobb pulled out another cigarette as they exited St. Ives. The men on the
stairs were&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p>“Maybe the kid was bein&#8217; held up or something, and this Darryl guy went to
help him out. From what she said, he sounds like he might have done somethin&#8217;
like that,” Ames commented as he unlocked the doors. “Am I still&nbsp;driving?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Ned felt uneasy as soon as Cobb and Ames entered the store. There was a
purposefulness in their walk that said they were on the job, they were looking
for someone; this was not just friendly stop for donuts and&nbsp;coffee.</p>
<p>Positioned at the register nearest to the entrance, he was their first stop.
They flashed a badge. “Police. Can you call the manager down for a second? We
need to speak with&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Ned nodded and walked to the intercom mounted on the support beam behind the
register. “Bob, please come to register one, Bob, to register one.” Bob was
the nearest thing to a manager today. He wasn&#8217;t the big man himself, but he
was in charge for the time&nbsp;being.</p>
<p>Ned returned to his position behind the register. “He&#8217;ll be right over.
Anything I can do for you&nbsp;gentlemen?”</p>
<p>Ames looked at Cobb for confirmation. “We&#8217;re looking for a girl that works
here, may be real friendly with the homeless guys that live around&nbsp;here.”</p>
<p>They were talking about Holly, no doubt. “This girl in some kind of
trouble?” Ned&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p>“Not at all. There was a homeless man that was murdered earlier this
morning, and we&#8217;re trying to identify him and figure out what happened. Rhonda
from St. Ives said this girl might know&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Ned was relieved. He had been concerned as soon as they had mentioned Holly.
He knew she&#8217;d had her run-ins with law enforcement before, but she was a good
kid &#8211; he didn&#8217;t want anything bad to happen to her. It looked like the police
officers just needed&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she was probably talking about Holly. She works here. She knows a lot
of the guys that live around here. I go out with her and talk to them every
once in awhile. Maybe I can help you&nbsp;out.”</p>
<p>Ames had already taken the Polaroid out of his pocket and thrust it into
Ned&#8217;s hand. He peered into it. It was a grisly photograph &#8211; the man in it was
obviously&nbsp;dead.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Holly&#8217;s talked to him a couple of times. He&#8217;s stopped by when she
brings pizza or hot chocolate or something, but I don&#8217;t know if she knows
anything more than what he does and where he works &#8211; on the street, I mean.
None of these guys have real jobs.” He handed the photo back to Ames&nbsp;.</p>
<p>“Tell you what, I think Holly just took a break. She might be out back
smoking or something. I can take you out there if you&#8217;d like.” He wanted to be
there when they talked to her &#8211; he could keep an eye on things and make sure
they hadn&#8217;t been lying to him about why they wanted to talk to&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Bob approached from the back of the store, smile pasted on his pale face as
always. “Hey Ned, you called? What do you&nbsp;need?”</p>
<p>Cobb spoke up before Ned had a chance to answer. “Well, your employee here
has been kind enough to help us out. We&#8217;ll let you know if you need anything
else.” He flashed his badge again. A confused expression clouded Bob&#8217;s face,
but he replaced it quickly with his award-winning smile and&nbsp;nodded.</p>
<p>Ned grinned to himself. It was satisfying to see the cops put Bob is his
place. Bob was too used to having things under his control, to being the
ultimate decision maker. But the cops didn&#8217;t even give him a second glance as
Ned led them to the back of the&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>As Ned had expected, Holly was standing outside in the back parking lot, a
lit cigarette between her lips. She smiled as Ned and the cops joined her on
the sidewalk. Cobb lit another cigarette and smoked while Ames explained the&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>Holly&#8217;s eyes teared upon inspection of the Polaroid. “Yeah, this is Darryl.
He&#8217;s really friendly. Such a great guy.” She cried harder, and Ned put his arm
around&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry ma&#8217;am. Do you happen to know anyone who would have wanted to kill&nbsp;him?”</p>
<p>Holly nodded, still crying softly. “Oh no, not at all. I mean, every once in
awhile somebody&#8217;d get huffy with him for cleaning their windshield, but Darryl
just let it go. I can&#8217;t imagine him doing anything to anyone that&#8217;d make them
want to kill&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Ames looked at Cobb, who signaled their departure by flicking his half-
finished cigarette to the ground. “Thank you, ma&#8217;am. And again, we&#8217;re sorry.”
The detectives made their way towards the back entrance to the&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Holly called softly. She ran up, tears still in her eyes. “Some of
the guys have been talking lately about something. Something that has them all
scared. They were saying that sometimes, one guy disappears for a night, then
shows up the next day all bruised and beat up. It happened to Darryl one time.
I tried to talk to him about it, but he wouldn&#8217;t tell me what had happened.
But everybody seems nervous about it these days. Even the homeless guys try to
stay in pairs now, just to be safer. Maybe it has something to do with that, I
don&#8217;t&nbsp;know.”</p>
<p>Ames and Cobb thanked her again and continued on into the store. Holly was
still crying as Ned put his arm around her&nbsp;again.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 13: Beat&nbsp;Down </strong></p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s vision focused slowly as he stormed into the room, yelling wildly.
His own voice was soon drowned out by Marie, shrieking maniacally at the top
of her lungs, and by that of a man as he jumped free from his position on top
of her and rolled off the side of the&nbsp;bed.</p>
<p>Marie clutched the sheets around her naked body and continued to shriek on
the bed, a fearful look in her eyes. Mike&#8217;s hands were still tightly grasping
the bat, and he ignored her screaming as he scanned the room for the man. He
moved around to the left side of the bed, where the man was cowering next to
the night table, holding his hands in front of his nude, trembling body in an
attempt to shield&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>Well, this was an interesting development. He glanced around the room in an
effort to discredit the conclusion he already knew to be true. The room was in
perfect condition, just like the rest of the house; no, Marie had <em>let</em> this
bastard into the&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>Marie regained her composure to some degree and shouted, both in fear and
anger, “Mike, what the hell are you&nbsp;doing?”</p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s mission now seemed clear. His job was gone, Angelo was going to kill
him, and Marie was cheating on him; with this pasty-faced bastard, no less. He
couldn&#8217;t do anything about the job or Angelo, but he&#8217;d be damned if he was
going to let her get away with this. She was going to&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>The weakness he&#8217;d been feeling on his trip home was now fading, replaced by
the familiar rage that fueled all his best work. He was starting to feel
normal again &#8211; in control. But this time was going to be different. He wasn&#8217;t
going to stomp around, screaming vulgarities and throwing things around the
room. This time he was going to do it fucking <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>Mike glanced back at Marie, a strange stillness in his eyes. He replied
icily, eyes staring blankly into the distance, “I&#8217;m fuckin&#8217; killing your
boyfriend, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m&nbsp;doing.”</p>
<p>He swung the bat down forcefully, striking the pale, sweating man on the
left side. His arm crumpled as he cried out in pain. He scrambled towards the
bed, looking for shelter, but Mike bent down, grabbed his ankle, and pulled
him out one handed. With his other hand he swung the bat again, hitting his
target just between the shoulder&nbsp;blades.</p>
<p>The man gasped, then went limp, and Mike struck again, with both hands this
time. The man&#8217;s body was unresponsive, and in his subconscious Mike realized
that he was either dead or knocked out, but the beating&nbsp;continued.</p>
<p>Marie jumped from the bed onto his back, screaming nonsensically at him and
pounding weakly at him with her fists. The man groaned unexpectedly and Mike
smiled inwardly at the realization that he wasn&#8217;t dead <em>yet</em>. The beating
could&nbsp;continue.</p>
<p>He grabbed Marie&#8217;s arm and swung her off his shoulder, then clutched her
towards him and threw her hard towards the left closet door. She smashed
awkwardly into the full-length mirror there, sending fireworks of sunlight
from the early afternoon sun around the room, and landed in a heap of broken
glass, broken skin, and&nbsp;tears.</p>
<p>Mike smiled at her. “That&#8217;s right, bitch,” he spoke smoothly, resuming his
swings with the bat. The man was now in a fetal position below him, moaning
softly. Bruises had already started to form on his legs and back, and his
disfigured arm gushed blood where white bone jutted incongruently out of his
pasty&nbsp;skin.</p>
<p>Mike pounded on him mercilessly with the bat, paying special attention to
his broken arm and now purple back, then abruptly dropped to his knees and
continued with his own fists, focusing on the face and neck. His own blood
mixed with the man&#8217;s as the cuts on his knuckles reopened. He raised his hand
for another blow, and without warning, stopped short, instead grabbing the bat
again and standing slowly&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>The tip of the bat was smeared a dark crimson now, and flecks of a similar
color dotted the sheets and bed surrounding the crumpled body of the man. Mike
smiled coldly, satisfied with his work. He looked over at Marie, where small
rivulets of her own blood ran along the glass pathways on the clean hardwood
floor, fueled by constant drops from fresh cuts on her back, legs and
buttocks. She caught his cold stare from behind a shroud of matted, blood-
flecked&nbsp;hair.</p>
<p>Mike turned and threw the bat at her feet. Its noisy clatter was drowned out
by her own surprised shriek, and she scrambled away quickly, leaving a broad
swath of crimson in her&nbsp;path.</p>
<p>Mike reached down and picked up the telephone on the night table, throwing
it at her. “You&#8217;d better call 911, Marie. I think your boyfriend needs to see
a doctor.” With that, he turned and strode quickly out of the room, down the
stairs, and into the&nbsp;kitchen.</p>
<p>He stopped at the sink, running cold water over his own wounded hands. The
white of his own knuckles shone through as the blood washed away. He saw
Marie&#8217;s purse in it&#8217;s customary position on the kitchen counter, and he swung
it over his shoulder as he walked to the&nbsp;garage.</p>
<p>Marie wouldn&#8217;t be needed her <span class="caps">SUV</span> &#8211; he might as well take it. It was really
his anyway, he&#8217;d paid for it. The angry adrenaline surged pleasantly through
him as he pressed the garage door button. Sunlight streamed brightly into the
dark garage as the door opened. <em>What a beautiful day</em>, he thought. He pulled
out slowly onto the street, and continued on through the path of finely
manicured lawns, stone yard fountains, and hedge art. It was time to go see&nbsp;Angelo.</p>
