I have gotten into a pretty nostalgic mood the last few years. I've started
re-watching a lot of the old cartoons I used to watch on static-ridden PAL
tapes when I was a kid. One of my all-time favorite shows was Thundercats, and
it seems that you can **finally** get [the first season on DVD][1]. All I can
say is, "It's about time!" And with my new job, I might even be able to afford
them!
