I am no doubt very late to the party, but I just discovered [PSGet](http://psget.net/) last week. I should write more about it, but for now, just open up the site in a new tab and check it out. If you use PowerShell you owe it to yourself.

In particular, get PSUrl -- cURL for PowerShell. ***Finally.***
