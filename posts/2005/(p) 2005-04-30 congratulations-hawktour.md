I'm pleased to say that the Hawktour project came away from IPRO Day with the
website award, and picked up second place in their track. I am really proud of
the team and how they managed to come together even though I abandoned them
half way through this semester. Santhosh did a great job pulling everything
together. Even though we didn't win our category, for three semesters we have
been a top-ranked team, and it's a source of great personal pride to know that
I was instrumental in getting us there.

  
But the real boon this semester was to finally beat out our arch-nemesis in
the website category, [IPRO 329][1]. They have consistently beat us in the
website category for the past two semesters, even though we have consistently
improved our site and they have done very little, if anything at all, to
theirs. At the beginning of the semester, Satish (the designer of the website
that rocketed us to website stardom three semesters ago) said that it was his
goal to win that category this semester. I am glad he made it happen. Topping
them was an even bigger deal than winning our category. I feel that IPRO Day
is a bit of a sham anyway. Of course, we'll take the awards if they want
to give them to us.

  
Check out the **award-winning** [Hawktour website][2], and see why all IPROs
should strive to be as good as we are.
