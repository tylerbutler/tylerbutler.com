                                    <p>For some reason I&#8217;ve been the target of telemarketers recently, and I think
I&#8217;ve found the secret to getting them to hang up and stop calling: <strong>just say no
three times.</strong> Three seems to be the magic number. The first two times you say
you&#8217;re not interested, they continue to pester, but the third time, they thank
you for your time and say goodbye. I have had much more success with this
method than with simply hanging up on them. First, that makes me feel rude,
and a telemarketer is still a person who has a job and there&#8217;s no reason for
me to be rude to them just because I&#8217;m annoyed. But second, and more
importantly, simply hanging up seems to increase the likelihood that the same
people will call me back with the same offer. Saying no three times seems to
reduce that likelihood in my non-scientific&nbsp;experimentation.</p>

                                    <p>Imagine my surprise when I was browsing my feeds at Google Reader today to see
the word &#8220;Pidgin&#8221; in my feeds. And in a Lifehacker post, no less! To
understand why I would be surprised, you have to remember that I grew up in
Papua New Guinea, where a trade language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tok_Pisin">Neo-Melanesian Pidgin</a>
(Tok Pisin in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular">vernacular</a>) is spoken by roughly 4 million people
there. It is commonly referred to as just &#8220;pidgin&#8221; by people that live in&nbsp;<span class="caps">PNG</span>.</p>
<p>In reality, pidgin is a generic linguistic term that refers to a language that
develops as a means to facilitate trade in areas where many different
languages are spoken by small people groups. Since ~850 languages are spoken
in <span class="caps">PNG</span>, it makes some sense that a pidgin would be born to facilitate trade
and communication. Neo-Melanesian pidgin is based on English and German. One
of the defining characteristics of pidgins is that they are typically just a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">lingua franca</a>, and not spoken as a first language by any people group.
Pidgins sometimes develop into creoles, which means that they then become more
full-fledged languages, because people learn to speak them as their first (and
sometimes only) language. This is the case with Haitian Creole (originally a
French Pidgin, now a French&nbsp;Creole).</p>
<p>Anyhow, the Pidgin Lifehacker was talking about is an <span class="caps">IM</span> client, much like
Trillian. Not quite what I was expecting, but given what a pidgin is, the name
is fitting.&nbsp;:-)</p>

says they&#8217;ll be working on a Linux port of Silverlight in the future. Sweet! I
was personally annoyed to find out that &#8220;cross-platform&#8221; only meant Mac and
Windows when Silverlight was officially announced. But it&#8217;s nice to see Mono
committing to filling the Linux gap. Best of luck to&nbsp;them!</p>

for a long time despite their growing popularity. In the MySpace case, it&#8217;s a
philosophical choice &#8211; MySpace sites are often so bad! They look horrible,
music plays when you go to them, the formatting is terrible… This is a natural
outcome of pure freedom; when you allow people to customize things and make
them look exactly like they want, you give them the freedom to make horrible
looking stuff. But I&#8217;m getting a bit off topic… Anyway, I avoid MySpace sort
of on principal, but I avoid Facebook due to some other reasons that I think
finally crystallized in my mind while attending a roundtable discussion at <span class="caps">MIX</span>
that included folks from Six Apart, Twitter, and&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p>The guy from Facebook was talking about how they view Facebook as being not an
<em>extension</em> of your identity, but rather a <em>representation</em> of it (my words,
not his; I&#8217;m trying to paraphrase the conversation). In other words, your
Facebook simply reflects the things that are happening to you, what&#8217;s going on
in your life, etc., and then shortens the gap between those events and
occurrences and the people that potentially care about you. Their philosophy
as I understand it is to reduce the amount of overhead that comes with keeping
track of what&#8217;s going on with&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a noble goal, I suppose, and one I can certainly appreciate given that
I have friends strewn all over the world (ever since the great Diaspora that
was my high school graduation in <span class="caps">PNG</span>). It certainly would be nice to always
know what was happening with those folks without ever having to do anything
about it. But I think that&#8217;s the crux of my opposition to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>You see, I think there is a great deal of worth in getting an email after a
long time from someone who has taken the time to write you and give you a
brief update about them. It took time and energy for them to write you and
update you on their life &#8211; and I believe it shows they care. This type of rich
interaction with someone occurs more naturally after a time out of&nbsp;touch.</p>
<p>Imagine a 30-year high-school reunion if everyone was on Facebook the entire
time after graduation? Would there be anything to talk about? I suppose the
conversation would revolve around politics, religion, and other matters of
<em>opinion</em>, because life events would simply be old news. Everyone would
already know that Sam got married last summer and Mary got a new job. There&#8217;d
be no excitement in learning that Joe&#8217;s son spoke his first words last week or
that Sally was finally able to get that surgery she&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re always connected to one another all the time, it removes the
excitement and enjoyment that comes from the <em>re</em>-connecting after a
disconnect. It&#8217;s cliché, to be sure, but absence makes the heart grow fonder,
and for that reason, Facebook&#8217;s just not for&nbsp;me.</p>
