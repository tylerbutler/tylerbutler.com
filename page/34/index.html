                                    <p>I finally got fed up with <span class="caps">XP</span> on my laptop. I don&#8217;t use it much for games
anymore, so I decided that it was time to try Linux again. I had previously
loaded Suse 9.1 on it over the summer, but I could never get my Linksys <span class="caps">WPC54G</span>
<span class="caps">PCMCIA</span> wireless card working, no matter what I tried, so I gave up. I didn&#8217;t
want to shell out cash for a new card, and a laptop without wireless is a
pitiful thing. Also, I used to like <span class="caps">KDE</span>, but it looked really bad on my
laptop, and I simply didn&#8217;t feel like going through all the hassle of trying
to get Gnome up on a <span class="caps">KDE</span>-centric distro. Finally at that point I was still
using Outlook (gasp!), and I didn&#8217;t relish trying to convert everything into
Evolution <em>again</em>. So I went back to <span class="caps">XP</span> for&nbsp;awhile.</p>
<p>Then I made the switch to GMail, and based on some high praise that
<a href="http://www.ubuntu-linux.org">Ubuntu</a> was getting from Patrick and others, I thought I might as well
give it a try. I needed to reformat my laptop anyway, and I figured if I
didn&#8217;t like it or it didn&#8217;t work, I could always just put <span class="caps">XP</span> back on&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Well, I am proud to say that Ubuntu up and running on my laptop. I was able to
<em>very</em> easily set up my wireless card using <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sf.net">NDiswrapper</a>, and there was
even a helpful guide linked to on the Ubuntu website. It doesn&#8217;t allow me to
monitor link quality and everything, but at least it&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>I have never used a Debian-based distro before, but I really like it so far.
The package management has been great, and using alien I&#8217;ve been able to load
up some <span class="caps">RPM</span>&#8217;s as Deb packages as well. I&#8217;ve got <a href="http://beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/">Tomboy</a> running, which is
cool (I&#8217;m using it for notes about my upcoming novel), and I am installing
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/beagle/">Beagle</a> as we speak. I like the overall polish of Gnome, but the &#8220;spatial
browsing&#8221; is driving me nuts. I want an address bar! I suppose I&#8217;ll get used
to it - it&#8217;s my only major complaint right now. Well, that and the fact that
there&#8217;s no <span class="caps">IE</span> for Linux (haha). I need it for work - Firefox doesn&#8217;t render
the application we use for ticket management correctly. I have to use <span class="caps">RDP</span> and
log into my server to enter tickets. And I&#8217;m still having problems getting
Samba and Web Folders shared between my Windows boxes and Ubuntu. But
hopefully <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?ifolder">iFolder</a> will help with&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Anyway, overall I am very pleased with my new setup so far, and have not yet
found any truly compelling reasons to switch back to <span class="caps">XP</span>. Here&#8217;s hoping I
don&#8217;t. I&#8217;m certainly learning a lot more with&nbsp;Linux.</p>

                                    <p>Microsoft is coming to campus on Thursday and Friday of this week, and I
managed to get an interview. One of the guys who&#8217;s coming is an alumnus from
<span class="caps">IIT</span>, and he used to be in <a href="http://www.hawktour.net/">my <span class="caps">IPRO</span></a> (back before it became <strong><em>my</em></strong> <span class="caps">IPRO</span>),
and he sent me an email asking if I knew of anyone from the <span class="caps">IPRO</span> that I would
recommend he interview. I gave him the only name I could in good conscience,
and suggested he interview me as well. So he asked for my resume, and I got an
email this afternoon requesting my preference for an interview time. I&#8217;m not
sure if any of it&#8217;s going to pan out, but it&#8217;s a good opportunity nonetheless.
I&#8217;m also not too sure how I feel about working for <span class="caps">MS</span>, but I&#8217;ll cross that
bridge if/when I come to it. Wish me&nbsp;luck!</p>
<hr />
<p><em>November 5,&nbsp;2004</em></p>
<p>Well, I made it past the first two hurdles. The on-campus interview went well,
and I must have impressed Ondrej enough that he pushed my resume on through to
an official recruiter. The recruiter emailed me today about setting up a phone
interview Wednesday next week. The way I understand it is that if the phone
interview goes well, then I&#8217;ll be heading out to Redmond for an on-site
interview. Then, if they&#8217;re <em>really</em> interested, I&#8217;ll get an&nbsp;offer.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am excited, but would appreciate your thoughts and prayers. This is
a big deal for me. I&#8217;m keeping my fingers&nbsp;crossed.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>December 17,&nbsp;2004</em></p>
<p>Well, I finally heard back from them today, and they are moving me through to
the next stage of the interview. I still don&#8217;t know the logistics yet, and it
kind of throws a wrench in the works with my current plans for next semester,
but I&#8217;m sure I can work something out if I get an offer.&nbsp;:-)</p>
<hr />
<p><em>January 21,&nbsp;2005</em></p>
<p>Looks like I am flying out to Seattle on February 7th, interviewing on the
8th, then flying back on the 9th. I am excited, but a little nervous as well.
Hopefully I&#8217;ll impress&nbsp;them.</p>

                                    <p>I have, after much thought, decided to disable anonymous commenting on this
site. For one thing, there are actually blog spammers who hit me with a few
long non-sensical spam comments every once in awhile. But I could deal with
that &#8211; and if I had the time, I could even upgrade <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">Geeklog</a> so it would
block most of the spam. But that wasn&#8217;t the real problem &#8211; the real problem is
that people post comments and I have absolutely no idea who they are. Most of
my friends are nice &#8211; Patrick and Kim usually sign their comment posts, which
is nice. There are, however, a few people who never do, and I am forced to go
looking through my access logs to figure out what <span class="caps">IP</span> accessed the site at the
approximate time the comment was posted, then lookup the <span class="caps">IP</span> and see if I can
think of anyone I might know that uses <span class="caps">ISP</span>. While I certainly do enjoy being
<a href="/2002/04/april-16-2002/">Sherlock Holmes</a> on occasion, this is just too much. So Pat, Kim, Ricardo,
and anyone else who indulges me by reading this, please just set yourself up an
account and post your comments &#8211; I really do like it when you post comments.
It makes me feel all warm and bubbly&nbsp;inside.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ode to the Nice&nbsp;Guys</strong></p>
<p><em>This rant was written for the Wharton Undergraduate&nbsp;Journal</em></p>
<p>This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that
never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching
about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is
dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain
themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give
reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at
department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how
cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate
moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in
honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest
concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girl&#8217;s every facet, from
her privacy to her theology to her clothing&nbsp;style.</p>
<p>This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back
from parties and never take advantage once they&#8217;re at her door, for the guys
who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male
population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give
them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the
rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material
but somehow don&#8217;t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are
overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are
manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>This is for that time she left 40 urgent messages on your cell phone, and
when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two
sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought
her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and
she shouldn&#8217;t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best
killing spree you&#8217;d ever orchestrated in <span class="caps">GTA3</span> to rant about a rumor that
romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in
the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing
against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a
counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she
didn&#8217;t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing “serious”
between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the
beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of
reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: “oh, but we&#8217;re just friends!” And
even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you
went anyways. Because you&#8217;re nice like&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>The nice guys don&#8217;t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more
disturbing, the nice guys don&#8217;t seem to get laid as often as they should. And
I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I can&#8217;t. From what I have
observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other
schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many
girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just
want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say
irrational, confusing things such as “oh, he&#8217;s too nice to date” or “he would
be a good boyfriend but he&#8217;s not for me” or “he already puts up with so much
from me, I couldn&#8217;t possibly ask him out!” or the most frustrating of all:
“no, it would ruin our friendship.” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of
datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends
to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls
like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I can&#8217;t figure out why the
connection breaks down between what they say (<em>I want a nice guy!</em>) and what
they do (<em>I&#8217;m going to sleep with this complete ass now!</em>). But one thing I
can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesn&#8217;t last
forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought
and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted.
The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones
that are&nbsp;single.</p>
<p>So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You
know who you are, and I know you&#8217;re sick of hearing yourself described as
ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your
patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party
escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all
the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you
are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my
gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your
well deserved vindication is&nbsp;coming.</p>

                                    <p>At work, we have a mindless task that has to be done manually every hour.
Basically, we have to log into this website and click around a bit to make
sure that the site is still up and running. It&#8217;s pretty ridiculous, I know,
but it has to be done nonetheless. No one in the office ever remembers to do
it, so I decided it might be nice to have an alarm of sorts. So I remembered
some of my old Micrososft Agent tinkering back in High School, and looked
around for some examples of using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/speech/download/sdk51/">Windows speech <span class="caps">API</span></a> in C#. It didn&#8217;t
take me long to figure it out, and the code for my simple text-to-speech
program is deceptively simple. Instead of providing the code as a download,
I&#8217;m just posting it here since it is so&nbsp;short.</p>

<p>Basically all you need is the code above and the Interop.SpeechLib.dll file,
which provides access to the speech utilities. For completeness (and since I
had some trouble finding the <span class="caps">DLL</span>), I put a copy of the file up on here.
This program basically just echoes back whatever string you pass in at the
command line, so to get the scheduling working, I just used Windows Task
Scheduler. I scheduled a task to run every hour ever day between 8am and 10pm
(check the advanced settings of the Task Scheduler), then pointed the task to
the compiled program, passing it the string I want it to say as the argument.
Simple. And it works. I still smile every time one of the office computers
says, &#8220;It is time to check&nbsp;Blackboard.&#8221;</p>
