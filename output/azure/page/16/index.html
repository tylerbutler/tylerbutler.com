                                    <p>Everyone repeat after me&#8230; <strong>Correlation does not <em>imply</em> causation!</strong> Just
because two things can be proven to correlate does not guarantee a cause and
effect relationship. Here&#8217;s a funny example from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">Wikipedia article</a> on
the topic (courtesy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:">The Simpsons</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Not a bear in sight. The &#8220;Bear Patrol&#8221; is working like a&nbsp;charm!</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: That&#8217;s specious reasoning,&nbsp;Dad.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: [<em>uncomprehendingly</em>] Thanks,&nbsp;honey.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: By your logic, I could claim that this rock keeps tigers&nbsp;away.</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: Hmm. How does it&nbsp;work?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: It doesn&#8217;t work. (<em>pause</em>) It&#8217;s just a stupid&nbsp;rock!</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>:&nbsp;Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: But I don&#8217;t see any tigers around, do&nbsp;you?</p>
<p><strong>Homer</strong>: (<em>pause</em>) Lisa, I want to buy your&nbsp;rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please please please stop assuming that determining a cause and effect
relationship is as straightforward as observing a correlation. It&#8217;s&nbsp;not.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I know the <code>!=</code> operator is not equivalent to &#8220;does not imply.&#8221; But I am 
too lazy right now to see if there&#8217;s even a Unicode character for the right&nbsp;symbol.</p>

                                    <p>Should you ever find yourself watching a street performer&#8217;s act, and you end
up volunteering, either willingly or unwillingly, to be a part of said act,
here&#8217;s a piece of advice: don&#8217;t run away when the performer&#8217;s not looking. If
you do, you might find out later that you&#8217;re missing something that might be
important to you. This is what happened to Emily, a rather skittish young
German woman who happens to be visiting Brisbane this week, and is now missing
her&nbsp;watch.</p>
<p>While I was walking back to the Kookaburra this afternoon, I passed through
the Queen Street Mall and stopped to view a street magician. Shortly after I
started watching, he approached a girl in the audience to act as his second
&#8220;assistant.&#8221; The girl didn&#8217;t look particularly happy to have been chosen, but
rather than protest she joined the performer in front of the audience. Soon
she was introduced s Emily from Germany, to much enthusiastic adulation from
the&nbsp;crowd.</p>
<p>The performer continued on with his act, which primarily involved his first
assistant, another young woman named Charlie. While he turned to face Charlie
and continued on, Emily turned and left, running swiftly into the swelling
crowd at the mall. It took a few seconds for both the audience and the
performer to figure out what was happening. The crowd started laughing at her
departure, but the performer yelled after her, &#8220;Wait! You&#8217;re missing
something!&#8221; With that, he pulled a hand watch from his pocket and waved it
above his head. Alas, Emily ran on, and was soon lost in the crowd. The
performer looked a bit baffled, jokingly offered the watch to anyone who would
buy it, then continued on with his act (with a new second&nbsp;assistant).</p>
<p>My first thought was that Emily was in on it, but after the act a few people
approached the performer and asked if it was scripted. He explained that it
wasn&#8217;t. He had removed her watch surreptitiously as part of his act and was
planning to reveal it to her later on. His intention was by no means to steal
her watch, but when she ran off so unexpectedly he didn&#8217;t know what to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>So people, if you wind up in a street performer&#8217;s act, please just be good-
natured about it and participate. It&#8217;s really not that&nbsp;hard.</p>

                                    <p>Seriously, the next time you&#8217;re in Portland, go to <a href="http://www.sanbornsbreakfast.com/">Sanborn&#8217;s</a> and get some breakfast. Freaking <strong><em>amazing</em></strong>
food. Elizabeth and I went there last weekend during our trip down there.
Despite the fact that we got lost (I blame our crummy <span class="caps">GPS</span> technology - or
maybe it was the navigator?), once we found it it lived up to the hype.
Definitely get the biscuits - I am drooling right now just thinking about
them… The pancakes and omelet&#8217;s were also very very good. It was busy, but
service was decent. We also went to <a href="http://www.lucystable.com/">Lucy&#8217;s Table</a> for dinner,
which I can also highly recommend. Excellent food and service, though it was a
bit pricey. I&#8217;d liken it to Café Juanita in Kirkland in terms of quality and
atmosphere. Unfortunately, not all of our dining experiences in the City of
Roses were good. Despite good reviews on CitySearch, the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=2&amp;url=http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/8470102/portland_or/j_m_cafe.html&amp;ei=F-2_Rt7KOJTshQPp7PHtCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9s9ncpZ9VZT_leK3fVMu9YQe7kA&amp;sig2=gBiGHh4kr9purLuxpfy2ng">J&amp;M Café</a> left a lot to be desired. Not outright <strong><em>bad</em></strong>, but definitely nothing to write home about. Meh. And also note that the only <a href="http://www.sonicdrivein.com/">Sonic</a> within 200 miles of Seattle is in a Portland suburb. Mmmmmm, <strong><em>so</em></strong> worth the&nbsp;drive.</p>

                                    <p>For some reason I&#8217;ve been the target of telemarketers recently, and I think
I&#8217;ve found the secret to getting them to hang up and stop calling: <strong>just say no
three times.</strong> Three seems to be the magic number. The first two times you say
you&#8217;re not interested, they continue to pester, but the third time, they thank
you for your time and say goodbye. I have had much more success with this
method than with simply hanging up on them. First, that makes me feel rude,
and a telemarketer is still a person who has a job and there&#8217;s no reason for
me to be rude to them just because I&#8217;m annoyed. But second, and more
importantly, simply hanging up seems to increase the likelihood that the same
people will call me back with the same offer. Saying no three times seems to
reduce that likelihood in my non-scientific&nbsp;experimentation.</p>

&#8216;07 Session</a>. While I am not quoted directly, my name is mentioned, and the
content of the session is referenced a&nbsp;bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="caps">MIX07</span> conference, Tyler Butler, a program manager for
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, pointed out three Web applications built
on SharePoint &#8211; Hawaiian Airlines, mobile phone game firm Glu Mobile and
music and event firm Hed Kandi&nbsp;Radio.</p>
<p>Butler also indicated that, since the SharePoint 2007 platform is built on
<span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> 2.0, developers can use <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and Silverlight to provide a rich
user&nbsp;interface.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try not to let the fame go to my&nbsp;head.</p>
