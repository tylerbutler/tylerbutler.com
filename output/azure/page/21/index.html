                                    <p>My session went pretty well yesterday, but unfortunately I had quite a few
demo issues. The session before mine went late, which made me pressed for time
to get things plugged up and ready to go. The first problem was that they
didn&#8217;t have my presentation pre-loaded on the presentation computer. So I
spent a few minutes looking for it, and then finally gave up, plugged in my
<span class="caps">USB</span> key to the back of the machine and just loaded it. Problem 1 solved, but
it got my nerves in a bit of a tizzy so I didn&#8217;t quite start with the bang I
wanted&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>The A/V guy thought I was ready to go as soon as the presentation was up and so
started everything, but I didn&#8217;t get a chance to double check that my demo
laptop was working properly and that the demos were going to be displayed
correctly. <em>Big mistake.</em> When it came time to do my demos, I couldn&#8217;t get any
signal from the laptop to the displays. I fiddled with it for what seemed like
an eternity, but in the end made the executive decision to just continue on so
I could make it through the core content. One problem with doing demos from
Vista machines is that I can never freaking find the right place to look to
change settings. It&#8217;s <em>very</em> frustrating, and when you&#8217;re nervous or anxious,
it just makes matters worse. For the demos I just did my best to explain the
points in the demos verbally, but of course that was a very poor&nbsp;substitute.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, I offered to show the demos on my laptop after the
talk for those that were interested. However, there were a number of
questions, and due to the wait and inactivity, Virtual <span class="caps">PC</span> stopped cooperating
and I couldn&#8217;t get anything to display on the demo box. &lt;sigh></p>
<p>For those of you who were at my session, please accept my sincere apologies
for the lack of demos. I had a much better, more cohesive presentation
planned. Hopefully the extended Q&amp;A was useful. Judging from the number of
great questions and business cards I got for follow up info, people still got
something out of the&nbsp;session.</p>
<p>I will be at the Mix Chat and attending various sessions throughout the rest
of the conference. If you want to chat with me, catch up with me at the
conference, or send me an email to set up some time to talk while we&#8217;re&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>I was very serious when I said that I&#8217;d like to start conversations with
everybody about their SharePoint experiences. We very much want to understand
where you perceive the problems to be so that we can address them. Believe it
or not, it&#8217;s not always as obvious to us as it is to you what we should do. So
we very much value your&nbsp;feedback!</p>

                                    <p>To expand on my post from earlier about .Net in the browser, here&#8217;s some of
the more salient points from the demos that Scott Guthrie et. al.&nbsp;showed:</p>
<p><strong>Debugging in both Windows and&nbsp;Mac</strong></p>
<p>Yup, you can attach to a remote process running on the Mac, and step into
breakpoints in your managed code locally in <span class="caps">VS</span>. This must have been <em>really</em>
hard to build. Nonetheless, this is super&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p><strong>Code behind for Silverlight&nbsp;projects </strong></p>
<p>This is basically how you get your .Net code in the browser. As far as I can
tell, your <span class="caps">XAML</span> has an associated code-behind page that contains all of your
code, as in pretty much all of&nbsp;<span class="caps">ASP</span>.Net</p>
<p><strong>Integration between Expression and <span class="caps">VS</span> for inserting <span class="caps">XAML</span> into the Silverlight project from&nbsp;Expression </strong></p>
<p>You can easily use the best app for the specific job. Designers can crack open
the <span class="caps">XAML</span> in Expression and munge it, then developers can live in <span class="caps">VS</span> and just
write the code. Everybody&nbsp;wins.</p>
<p><strong>Add Silverlight projects to <span class="caps">ASP</span>.Net projects, get them built and deployed&nbsp;together </strong></p>
<p>Silverlight controls can be just like regular .Net controls, and get built as
part of the same development workflow.&nbsp;Sweeeeeet&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>http://silverlight.metaliq.com/topbanana/</strong></p>
<p>Really nifty light table app completely in the browser built in C# and <span class="caps">XAML</span>
and delivered via Silverlight. Apparently this will be a sample app that will
be part of the <span class="caps">SDK</span> or something, which is pretty sweet. I was hoping it&#8217;d be
live so everyone could play, but it&#8217;s not. Built in a month with alpha
Silverlight 1.1&nbsp;code.</p>

                                    <p>I&#8217;m at <span class="caps">MIX</span>! Got in late last night. Wow, Vegas is nuts. So gaudy &#8211; lights,
sounds, smells everywhere. It&#8217;s pretty overwhelming. The Venetian is
fantastically humongous. I have to walk a mile from my room to the part of the
hotel where <span class="caps">MIX</span> is actually taking place. First time in a 5-star hotel for me,
so I am&nbsp;pleased.</p>
<p>Right now I am sitting in the keynote session waiting for it to get started at
9:30 <span class="caps">PST</span>. There&#8217;s a pretty cool &#8220;screen saver&#8221; thing that is loading live
<a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> comments from <span class="caps">MIX</span> attendees and displaying them on the screen in
real-time. Pretty cool. Not a big Twitter fan myself, but it&#8217;s certainly being
used in interesting ways here at&nbsp;<span class="caps">MIX</span>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a three piece band playing with an accordion, violin, upright bass,
and assorted other instruments. One attendee described it as a love child
between Tom Waits and Oingo Boingo. Did I just hear a glockenspiel? A freakin&#8217;
Theremin too?&nbsp;Fantastic…</p>
<p>Well, keynote should start shortly… More coming&nbsp;up&#8230;</p>
