[Mencius Moldbug][2] on why Wolfram Alpha shouldn't have a natural language-based
interface:

> _You_ know that when you type "two cups of flour and two eggs" (which now
[works][1]) you are looking for a Nutrition Facts label. It is only Stephen
Wolfram's giant electronic brain which has to run ten million lines of code to
figure this out. Inside your _own_ brain, it is written on glowing letters
across your forehead.
