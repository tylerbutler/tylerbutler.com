                </header>
                                    <p>The lights downstairs were all off. The dishes from Mike&#8217;s breakfast earlier
in the morning still sat in the sink; the soft sound of water drops echoed in
the silent twilight of the&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>Mike glanced around expectantly, all five of his sense on maximum awareness,
ready to respond. Someone was in his house &#8211; he could feel it. Someone had the
audacity to enter his home &#8211; <em>his home</em> &#8211; and do something &#8211; what he didn&#8217;t
yet know &#8211; but whatever it was, he knew he wasn&#8217;t going to like&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He stepped quietly to the closet in the den and picked up his trusty
baseball bat. If someone wanted to get physical with him, he was going to have
something other than his fists to protect him. He still had seen no sign of
the intruders, but he knew they were there somewhere, and he was going to
introduce them to Big&nbsp;Bertha.</p>
<p>Now armed with the bat, he moved slowly towards the stairs up to the second
floor of the house. The creaking of the carpeted stairs hid the sounds
floating down from upstairs until he made it to the narrow hall at the top of
the&nbsp;stairs.</p>
<p>Once there, the sound was clearly audible. He turned left towards it, bat
held at the ready, and crept towards the bedroom. The perspiration collected
in large beads along his forehead, then ran down into his eyes. He didn&#8217;t dare
remove his hands from the bat to wipe them, and instead ignored the burning
sensation and slightly blurred vision the saline sweat&nbsp;produced.</p>
<p>He reached the bedroom, the apparent source of the sound. The door was only
partly open, and he sidled alongside the doorway, back pressed against the
wall. He peered inside the crack of the door, but nothing was&nbsp;visible.</p>
<p>The sounds were growing louder. Soft, hushed breathing and occasional low
moans had turned into groans and raspy, labored breaths, coming at a much
greater frequency than before. Mike took a deep breath, gripped the handle of
the bat till his knuckles turned white, turned and stormed into the bedroom,
yelling at top of his&nbsp;lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 12:&nbsp;Identification</strong></p>
<p>“Wow, what a dump,” Cobb said as he stepped into the small one bedroom
apartment. “Not much of a decorator, is he?” The apartment was bare except for
a small unmade bed in the corner. The floor was bare cement, the normally
white walls a light brown from months of city soot and&nbsp;grime.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess you get what you pay for,” Ames commented as he moved deeper
into the interior of the apartment. “Doesn&#8217;t look like there&#8217;s a whole lot
here. The landlord did say the kid had been subletting the place, and that the
other two tenants left about a month&nbsp;ago.”</p>
<p>“Two people lived&nbsp;here?”</p>
<p>“Well, not everyone has the benefits of a detective&#8217;s salary, Cobb,” Ames
smiled wryly. Cobb shook his head in response. “Hard to believe, that&#8217;s&nbsp;all.”</p>
<p>He detectives glanced around&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here. Maybe the kid was just coming
back today. He did have those tickets in his&nbsp;backpack.”</p>
<p>“All right. What&nbsp;next?”</p>
<p>Cobb sat down on the bed, looking around the room in thought. “They said the
other guy was most likely homeless, right?” Ames nodded. “Not too unusual in
this part of town. I think there&#8217;s a shelter down on Sullivan. Maybe somebody
there knows the&nbsp;guy.”</p>
<p>“You read my mind. Let&#8217;s go.” He slapped his hands on his thighs and stood
up, following Ames out of the ground floor apartment and back to their car.
“You drive,” he said, throwing Ames the&nbsp;keys.</p>
<p>Ames was surprised. “Say what? You never let me drive? What&#8217;s the&nbsp;deal?”</p>
<p>“I just want to look around a bit. You&nbsp;drive.”</p>
<p>Ames didn&#8217;t argue. Cobb was reticent as he started up the engine and pulled
slowly out of the apartment complex and back onto the main road, making his
way towards Sullivan Street&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Cobb looked out of the passenger side window at the groups of homeless men
and women underneath the bridges as they passed. Their faces were dirty, hair
greasy, a broken, beaten look in their&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>He thought back to the last summer he&#8217;d spent with his mother. He&#8217;d grown up
in a neighborhood not unlike this one. He didn&#8217;t remember exactly how it had
happened, but one day, his mother had come home from work telling him to pack
his things into his small backpack, and they&#8217;d left the apartment that had
been his&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>They had walked forever that day, him with his backpack, his mother with a
small blue suitcase. When evening fell, they had found shelter under a bridge
with others like themselves &#8211; others with nowhere else to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Cobb hadn&#8217;t liked it there at first. The cement was a hard, cold bed, and
the others there had smelled funny, but his mother had held him close, told
him that everything was going to be <span class="caps">OK</span>, and eventually he was able to fall&nbsp;asleep.</p>
<p>Every day they followed the same routine &#8211; they&#8217;d get up, repack their
belongings, and walk around the city streets, looking for whatever they could
find. At first, his mother went into a few places looking for jobs. Cobb would
sit out in front of the store, patiently watching his backpack and the blue
suitcase, but every time his mother returned with a sad look on her face, and
they started walking&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Eventually, his mother stopped looking for jobs and started looking for
food. Cobb was always hungry, and so their lives became a constant search for
sustenance. His mother would take his hand and they&#8217;d walk along the alleys,
looking in dumpsters for food or other things that might prove valuable in
trade to someone&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>This had been his life for that summer. Towards the end, his mother had
started leaving him under the bridge in the evening. She would return a few
hours later, often with new bruises, but the next morning, his mother would
pull out a small wad of crumpled cash, and they would go out and have a big
breakfast, with orange juice, eggs, and pancakes, and sometimes, they&#8217;d go to
the carwash and wash themselves with the hose. Those had been his favorite&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>One day a policeman had stopped them on the street and had taken them to the
police station. He had sat on the bench with his mother fearfully clutching
her hand, and had cried incessantly when she said she had to go and he would
have a new family and a new&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Social Services had placed him with a foster family, and he had gone back to
school. The foster family was nice enough, but all he had really wanted was
his mother. He hadn&#8217;t seen her since that day in the police station. He
wondered now, as he peered out on the dirty faces, if perhaps one of them was&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Abruptly, the car turned onto Sullivan Street and Cobb was drawn back into&nbsp;reality.</p>
<p>“There it is, at the corner, on the right,” said Ames quietly as they
approached the St. Ives shelter. Cobb looked up at the large stone structure
looming in front of them. The white brick exterior was worn and caked with
city grime. The large orange neon cross above the entrance flickered “Jesus
Loves You.” A few grubby, coated figures sat on the large stairs, sharing a
cigarette between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ames pulled up next to the entrance and parked the car.&nbsp;“Ready?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, let&#8217;s go.” Cobb pulled his jacket tighter around him as they exited
the car and walked towards the figures sitting on the stairs. They seemed to
have the right idea. He could really use a cigarette right now. He pulled one
from his pocket and lit it as he and Ames took the stairs towards the&nbsp;entrance.</p>
<p>“Better not smoke that inside,” one of the figures on the stairs said as
they passed by. Cobb stopped and turned. “Why&nbsp;not?”</p>
<p>“Rhonda won&#8217;t like it. She doesn&#8217;t let us smoke inside. Why else you think
we&#8217;d be sittin&#8217; out here? Shit, it&#8217;s <em>warm</em> in there.” The man gestured
towards St. Ives. The others sharing the cigarette&nbsp;laughed.</p>
<p>Cobb handed the cigarette to the man. “Well, I guess you guys can have this
one on&nbsp;me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks, officer,” the man responded, accepting Cobb&#8217;s&nbsp;offer.</p>
<p>“Is it that obvious?” Cobb asked, putting his hands in his jacket&nbsp;pockets.</p>
<p>“Only cops move the way you two do,” the man responded, inhaling Cobb&#8217;s
cigarette slowly before passing it along to the next one in the small&nbsp;circle.</p>
<p>Cobb smiled. “Must be our police training.” A few men chuckled as he turned
and followed Ames into the large St. Ives&nbsp;vestibule.</p>
<p>“Sounds like Rhonda&#8217;s the one we want to talk to,” said Cobb as they hung
their coats on the rack in the corner. Ames murmured in agreement, and they
walked up the short staircase into the large dining hall. It was mostly empty,
except for one of two men sitting at distant tables,&nbsp;eating.</p>
<p>The only sounds seemed to be coming from a door at the far side of the room,
so they walked in that direction, aware of the strong smell of food wafting
more strongly as they&nbsp;approached.</p>
<p>“They say it&#8217;s warm in here?” Ames commented as they entered the doorway to
the kitchen. “Seems chilly to&nbsp;me.”</p>
<p>“Wal, you try heatin&#8217; a big old place like dis wit what money we got!
‘Sides, it&#8217;s warmer than outside, and that&#8217;s warm enough for most folks here.”
Rhonda turned from the kitchen sink and wiped her hands on her&nbsp;apron.</p>
<p>“Are you Rhonda?” Ames asked, stopping at the entrance to the&nbsp;kitchen.</p>
<p>“Sho ‘nuff,” Rhonda replied. “And you must be cops. Only cops walk the way
you do. What can I do for&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>Cobb interrupted, “Hi Rhonda, I&#8217;m Detective Cobb and this is my partner,
Detective Ames. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard yet, but there were a couple of
men found earlier this morning, and one of them is dead. He appeared to be
homeless, so we were wondering if he&#8217;d have maybe come in here. We&#8217;re just
trying to find out who he is and how he got&nbsp;shot.”</p>
<p>“Shot? Well, dat&#8217;s a new one for one of my guys. Usually they do a pretty
good job of staying out o&#8217; da way of guns. You got a picture?” Ames nodded,
reaching into his jacket pocket for the&nbsp;Polaroid.</p>
<p>“Ma&#8217;am, this is from the crime scene,&nbsp;so&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Just let me see it. I&#8217;ve seen worse, I&#8217;m sure.” Rhonda walked over,
accepted the picture, and inspected it with a frown on her face, shaking her&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this is Darryl. I don&#8217;t know his last name.” She shook her head
again. “Poor guy. Guys around here call him da Squeegee Man, on ‘ccount o&#8217; his
always cleaning car windows down on State Ave. Last time he came in, he was
pretty beat up, but he didn&#8217;t seem to wanna talk about it. We don&#8217;t pressure
‘em ‘round here. He ate a bit, talked to Ernie once, but didn&#8217;t stay the
night. I hadn&#8217;t seem him since den.” She handed the picture back to Ames&nbsp;.</p>
<p>“Do you know anything more about him? Any reason you can think of that he
would have been shot?” Rhonda shook her&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>“No, Darryl was a nice guy, real friendly and he&#8217;d talk your ear off if you
let him. He was different last I saw him, though. Real quiet. Like I said, he
was beat up. I spect he got in front of that bullet by accident &#8211; he wasn&#8217;t
the kind to seek out&nbsp;trouble.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>. You mentioned he talked to Ernie last time he was here. Who&#8217;s&nbsp;Ernie?”</p>
<p>Rhonda smiled. “He&#8217;s a reg&#8217;lar ‘round here. He&#8217;s not all right in the head,
but he&#8217;s a sweet boy. He didn&#8217;t have anything to do with this, I can tell you
dat. He used to talk to Darryl a lot; went out with him to State Ave.&nbsp;once.”</p>
<p>“Any idea where we can find&nbsp;him?”</p>
<p>“Wal, he usually goes down and hangs out with some kids around 34 th and
Broadway, but I doubt you&#8217;ll get much from him. Ernie can&#8217;t describe things
very well. His mind don&#8217;t work dat way. Tell you what, though, there&#8217;s a girl
that some of da guys talk about ‘round here. She works up at the Dominick&#8217;s
just up the street. Da guys say she&#8217;s real nice. I know Darryl knew her; Ernie
does too. She might know somethin&#8217; more. Sometimes dey talk to other people
better &#8211; they don&#8217;t tell me too much. Now, I&#8217;ve gotta get the rest of this
food made, we&#8217;ll be having a large crowd here for lunch in a bit. ‘Scuse me.”
She brushed pas Ames and Cobb and rummaged around the&nbsp;counter.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>. Thanks a lot ma&#8217;am. If you hear anything just give us a call at the
station.” Rhonda nodded, and Cobb turned back and left the kitchen, Ames close&nbsp;behind.</p>
<p>“You want to head over to the Dominick&#8217;s?” Ames&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p>“Might as well. Foster&#8217;s going to call us when the kid wakes up. Might as
well try to figure out why the homeless guy&#8217;s&nbsp;dead.”</p>
<p>Cobb pulled out another cigarette as they exited St. Ives. The men on the
stairs were&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p>“Maybe the kid was bein&#8217; held up or something, and this Darryl guy went to
help him out. From what she said, he sounds like he might have done somethin&#8217;
like that,” Ames commented as he unlocked the doors. “Am I still&nbsp;driving?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Ned felt uneasy as soon as Cobb and Ames entered the store. There was a
purposefulness in their walk that said they were on the job, they were looking
for someone; this was not just friendly stop for donuts and&nbsp;coffee.</p>
<p>Positioned at the register nearest to the entrance, he was their first stop.
They flashed a badge. “Police. Can you call the manager down for a second? We
need to speak with&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Ned nodded and walked to the intercom mounted on the support beam behind the
register. “Bob, please come to register one, Bob, to register one.” Bob was
the nearest thing to a manager today. He wasn&#8217;t the big man himself, but he
was in charge for the time&nbsp;being.</p>
<p>Ned returned to his position behind the register. “He&#8217;ll be right over.
Anything I can do for you&nbsp;gentlemen?”</p>
<p>Ames looked at Cobb for confirmation. “We&#8217;re looking for a girl that works
here, may be real friendly with the homeless guys that live around&nbsp;here.”</p>
<p>They were talking about Holly, no doubt. “This girl in some kind of
trouble?” Ned&nbsp;asked.</p>
<p>“Not at all. There was a homeless man that was murdered earlier this
morning, and we&#8217;re trying to identify him and figure out what happened. Rhonda
from St. Ives said this girl might know&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Ned was relieved. He had been concerned as soon as they had mentioned Holly.
He knew she&#8217;d had her run-ins with law enforcement before, but she was a good
kid &#8211; he didn&#8217;t want anything bad to happen to her. It looked like the police
officers just needed&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she was probably talking about Holly. She works here. She knows a lot
of the guys that live around here. I go out with her and talk to them every
once in awhile. Maybe I can help you&nbsp;out.”</p>
<p>Ames had already taken the Polaroid out of his pocket and thrust it into
Ned&#8217;s hand. He peered into it. It was a grisly photograph &#8211; the man in it was
obviously&nbsp;dead.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Holly&#8217;s talked to him a couple of times. He&#8217;s stopped by when she
brings pizza or hot chocolate or something, but I don&#8217;t know if she knows
anything more than what he does and where he works &#8211; on the street, I mean.
None of these guys have real jobs.” He handed the photo back to Ames&nbsp;.</p>
<p>“Tell you what, I think Holly just took a break. She might be out back
smoking or something. I can take you out there if you&#8217;d like.” He wanted to be
there when they talked to her &#8211; he could keep an eye on things and make sure
they hadn&#8217;t been lying to him about why they wanted to talk to&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Bob approached from the back of the store, smile pasted on his pale face as
always. “Hey Ned, you called? What do you&nbsp;need?”</p>
<p>Cobb spoke up before Ned had a chance to answer. “Well, your employee here
has been kind enough to help us out. We&#8217;ll let you know if you need anything
else.” He flashed his badge again. A confused expression clouded Bob&#8217;s face,
but he replaced it quickly with his award-winning smile and&nbsp;nodded.</p>
<p>Ned grinned to himself. It was satisfying to see the cops put Bob is his
place. Bob was too used to having things under his control, to being the
ultimate decision maker. But the cops didn&#8217;t even give him a second glance as
Ned led them to the back of the&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>As Ned had expected, Holly was standing outside in the back parking lot, a
lit cigarette between her lips. She smiled as Ned and the cops joined her on
the sidewalk. Cobb lit another cigarette and smoked while Ames explained the&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>Holly&#8217;s eyes teared upon inspection of the Polaroid. “Yeah, this is Darryl.
He&#8217;s really friendly. Such a great guy.” She cried harder, and Ned put his arm
around&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry ma&#8217;am. Do you happen to know anyone who would have wanted to kill&nbsp;him?”</p>
<p>Holly nodded, still crying softly. “Oh no, not at all. I mean, every once in
awhile somebody&#8217;d get huffy with him for cleaning their windshield, but Darryl
just let it go. I can&#8217;t imagine him doing anything to anyone that&#8217;d make them
want to kill&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Ames looked at Cobb, who signaled their departure by flicking his half-
finished cigarette to the ground. “Thank you, ma&#8217;am. And again, we&#8217;re sorry.”
The detectives made their way towards the back entrance to the&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Holly called softly. She ran up, tears still in her eyes. “Some of
the guys have been talking lately about something. Something that has them all
scared. They were saying that sometimes, one guy disappears for a night, then
shows up the next day all bruised and beat up. It happened to Darryl one time.
I tried to talk to him about it, but he wouldn&#8217;t tell me what had happened.
But everybody seems nervous about it these days. Even the homeless guys try to
stay in pairs now, just to be safer. Maybe it has something to do with that, I
don&#8217;t&nbsp;know.”</p>
<p>Ames and Cobb thanked her again and continued on into the store. Holly was
still crying as Ned put his arm around her&nbsp;again.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 13: Beat&nbsp;Down </strong></p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s vision focused slowly as he stormed into the room, yelling wildly.
His own voice was soon drowned out by Marie, shrieking maniacally at the top
of her lungs, and by that of a man as he jumped free from his position on top
of her and rolled off the side of the&nbsp;bed.</p>
<p>Marie clutched the sheets around her naked body and continued to shriek on
the bed, a fearful look in her eyes. Mike&#8217;s hands were still tightly grasping
the bat, and he ignored her screaming as he scanned the room for the man. He
moved around to the left side of the bed, where the man was cowering next to
the night table, holding his hands in front of his nude, trembling body in an
attempt to shield&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>Well, this was an interesting development. He glanced around the room in an
effort to discredit the conclusion he already knew to be true. The room was in
perfect condition, just like the rest of the house; no, Marie had <em>let</em> this
bastard into the&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>Marie regained her composure to some degree and shouted, both in fear and
anger, “Mike, what the hell are you&nbsp;doing?”</p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s mission now seemed clear. His job was gone, Angelo was going to kill
him, and Marie was cheating on him; with this pasty-faced bastard, no less. He
couldn&#8217;t do anything about the job or Angelo, but he&#8217;d be damned if he was
going to let her get away with this. She was going to&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>The weakness he&#8217;d been feeling on his trip home was now fading, replaced by
the familiar rage that fueled all his best work. He was starting to feel
normal again &#8211; in control. But this time was going to be different. He wasn&#8217;t
going to stomp around, screaming vulgarities and throwing things around the
room. This time he was going to do it fucking <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>Mike glanced back at Marie, a strange stillness in his eyes. He replied
icily, eyes staring blankly into the distance, “I&#8217;m fuckin&#8217; killing your
boyfriend, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m&nbsp;doing.”</p>
<p>He swung the bat down forcefully, striking the pale, sweating man on the
left side. His arm crumpled as he cried out in pain. He scrambled towards the
bed, looking for shelter, but Mike bent down, grabbed his ankle, and pulled
him out one handed. With his other hand he swung the bat again, hitting his
target just between the shoulder&nbsp;blades.</p>
<p>The man gasped, then went limp, and Mike struck again, with both hands this
time. The man&#8217;s body was unresponsive, and in his subconscious Mike realized
that he was either dead or knocked out, but the beating&nbsp;continued.</p>
<p>Marie jumped from the bed onto his back, screaming nonsensically at him and
pounding weakly at him with her fists. The man groaned unexpectedly and Mike
smiled inwardly at the realization that he wasn&#8217;t dead <em>yet</em>. The beating
could&nbsp;continue.</p>
<p>He grabbed Marie&#8217;s arm and swung her off his shoulder, then clutched her
towards him and threw her hard towards the left closet door. She smashed
awkwardly into the full-length mirror there, sending fireworks of sunlight
from the early afternoon sun around the room, and landed in a heap of broken
glass, broken skin, and&nbsp;tears.</p>
<p>Mike smiled at her. “That&#8217;s right, bitch,” he spoke smoothly, resuming his
swings with the bat. The man was now in a fetal position below him, moaning
softly. Bruises had already started to form on his legs and back, and his
disfigured arm gushed blood where white bone jutted incongruently out of his
pasty&nbsp;skin.</p>
<p>Mike pounded on him mercilessly with the bat, paying special attention to
his broken arm and now purple back, then abruptly dropped to his knees and
continued with his own fists, focusing on the face and neck. His own blood
mixed with the man&#8217;s as the cuts on his knuckles reopened. He raised his hand
for another blow, and without warning, stopped short, instead grabbing the bat
again and standing slowly&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>The tip of the bat was smeared a dark crimson now, and flecks of a similar
color dotted the sheets and bed surrounding the crumpled body of the man. Mike
smiled coldly, satisfied with his work. He looked over at Marie, where small
rivulets of her own blood ran along the glass pathways on the clean hardwood
floor, fueled by constant drops from fresh cuts on her back, legs and
buttocks. She caught his cold stare from behind a shroud of matted, blood-
flecked&nbsp;hair.</p>
<p>Mike turned and threw the bat at her feet. Its noisy clatter was drowned out
by her own surprised shriek, and she scrambled away quickly, leaving a broad
swath of crimson in her&nbsp;path.</p>
<p>Mike reached down and picked up the telephone on the night table, throwing
it at her. “You&#8217;d better call 911, Marie. I think your boyfriend needs to see
a doctor.” With that, he turned and strode quickly out of the room, down the
stairs, and into the&nbsp;kitchen.</p>
<p>He stopped at the sink, running cold water over his own wounded hands. The
white of his own knuckles shone through as the blood washed away. He saw
Marie&#8217;s purse in it&#8217;s customary position on the kitchen counter, and he swung
it over his shoulder as he walked to the&nbsp;garage.</p>
<p>Marie wouldn&#8217;t be needed her <span class="caps">SUV</span> &#8211; he might as well take it. It was really
his anyway, he&#8217;d paid for it. The angry adrenaline surged pleasantly through
him as he pressed the garage door button. Sunlight streamed brightly into the
dark garage as the door opened. <em>What a beautiful day</em>, he thought. He pulled
out slowly onto the street, and continued on through the path of finely
manicured lawns, stone yard fountains, and hedge art. It was time to go see&nbsp;Angelo.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 11:&nbsp;Debt</strong></p>
<p>Mike came to propped up against the side of the tower. His head hurt. It
took him a few moments to remember what he was doing there. He was vaguely
conscious of a uniformed security guard standing just inside the tower door,
peering out the window at him. As he looked back at the man, the security
guard raised his walkie talkie to his mouth, uttered a few words, and turned
away from&nbsp;Mike.</p>
<p>The two security men who&#8217;d escorted Mike out of the tower hadn&#8217;t known what
to do with his unmoving body. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon for them to drag a recently
fired employee out of the office, but they had always stayed&nbsp;conscious.</p>
<p>Mike collected his muddy thought, rubbed his head and slowly stood up. The
adrenaline that had fueled his angry tirade earlier was now gone, and the
realization that he was in deep shit had fully sunk in, leaving his mouth dry,
his head aching, and his knees&nbsp;weak.</p>
<p>He was dizzy. What was he going to do? He tried to ignore it, but the
thought of what Angelo was going to do to him kept coming back. He had needed
that bonus! He willed himself to get angry again &#8211; to muster up the chemicals
in his brain that would restore him to his normal self &#8211; but nothing would
come. He was too tired. He wanted to sleep for a very long time. In his
dejection he found it strangely humorous that he would soon get his wish; when
Angelo found out he didn&#8217;t have the money, he&#8217;d make sure that Mike would be
sleeping for a <em>very</em> long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>He eventually became aware of the people staring at him. He must have looked
very awkward, staggering on his feet, blood on his shirt, hair mussy, a
distant look in his unfocused eyes. But why did they stare? Had they never
seen a jobless guy downtown&nbsp;before?</p>
<p>“Screw you!” he yelled at a passing woman who&#8217;d kept her eyes on him for a
moment too long. She jumped and scurried on along, looking back every so often
as if she was worried he might follow&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>Finally his head stopped swimming and he gingerly stepped off the tower
stairs down towards the street. The security guard was there in the window
again, no doubt ordered to keep an eye on him. He spoke into his walkie talkie
again, and maintained his watchful gaze as Mike stepped along the street&nbsp;slowly.</p>
<p>It occurred to Mike, as he staggered down the street, that he had no money
for a cab on his person. He normally kept his wallet on him, but on this
particular day he&#8217;d worn his nice Italian pants; the back pocket was far too
small for his oversized wallet, stuffed with business cards, credit cards, and
pictures of his wife to show potential customers. It&#8217;s large bulge in the back
pocket of these particular pants was unsightly, not to mention uncomfortable,
so he had placed it in the briefcase along with his files &#8211; the briefcase that
was by now being ransacked by Maureen and her team in search of his notes on
his new&nbsp;campaign.</p>
<p>He reached in his pocket, feeling for his keys and cell phone &#8211; they were
still there, along with his train pass and a few cents in loose change. At
least he could call Marie. He fumbled with the phone a few minutes before he
finally got the number punched in. There was no answer? She hadn&#8217;t been there
earlier either; where was&nbsp;she?</p>
<p>Without consciously realizing it, he&#8217;d been walking towards the State Avenue
train station. It was just as well. He could at least ride the train up
towards his house, then try calling Marie again and hope she would answer. She
could pick him up at the&nbsp;station.</p>
<p>As he approached the platform, he reached in his pocket and quickly counted
the change he had. He was 50 cents short of what he needed to get back up&nbsp;north.</p>
<p>He sighed, defeated, realizing the sick sense of humor the universe must
have. He began to ask passersby if they could help him out with a little
change, but they shrugged him off and hurried by. Why didn&#8217;t they believe his
story? He wasn&#8217;t a degenerate &#8211; he was an important man! And he only needed 50
cents! It wasn&#8217;t a big deal! The irony was not entirely lost on him as he
remembered the earlier events of the morning. referring back to beggar story
with Mike, need to addYes, the universe had a sick sense of&nbsp;humor.</p>
<p>After several unsuccessful attempts at soliciting assistance, and a couple
of close scrapes with a public transportation employee who seemed to enjoy
pointing ominously at the small signs posted around the station that read,
“Solicitation Prohibited,” Mike tried a new approach. He checked around the
vending machines at the station, poking his finger into the change return and
fishing under the machine with his hands. His efforts yielded two dimes, three
nickels, and a collection of pennies, which he exchanged with the public
transportation employee for additional nickels and&nbsp;dimes.</p>
<p>Before long, he had the requisite 50 cents and found himself on a northbound
train, heading home. He was emotionally drained. Hopelessness enveloped him,
and he tried to sleep, but was constantly plagued by nightmares of Angelo&#8217;s
response to Mike&#8217;s explanation of why he didn&#8217;t have the&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>It had all started two months ago, when Mike was riding high on the success
of another of his accounts. This account was much, much smaller than Richmond,
but the campaign he&#8217;d designed had worked considerably well, and he felt the
need to celebrate that fact in some&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>He had overheard a conversation in the office regarding a horse that was “a
sure thing.” Mike had never thought of himself as a gambler, though others
would no doubt have termed him that, but when thinking about just how to
celebrate his recent victory at Copeland, a sizable bet on a “sure thing”
seemed to be just the thing. There were few things more exciting to Mike than
watching money turn into more money (this was an important thing in
advertising &#8211; it was his job to turn a client&#8217;s advertising budget into
revenues), and his cursory research into the horse, named Day Tripper,
indicated that he had a good chance to do well with his bet. His own research
coupled with the overheard office discussion made his decision decisively&nbsp;simple.</p>
<p>He had called up Angelo, whose number had been collecting dust in his
Rolodex, and put a sizable bet on Day Tripper to win. Angelo had been more
than happy to take Mike&#8217;s bet, reminding him again of the debtor&#8217;s obligations
to his creditor. Mike had brushed it off; Day Tripper was a sure thing &#8211; it
was money in the&nbsp;bank.</p>
<p>That was when things started to go wrong. Day Tripper had lost miserably,
and the following day at Copeland he was informed that his client had
misreported their revenue from the last campaign, and the ads weren&#8217;t doing as
well as they had initially thought. Mike had had his first and only out of
body experience at that point, and upon returning to normal, had proceeded to
throw random objects around the office and threaten to fire each and every
person on his&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>Angelo, of course, was pleased with the outcome, and was sickeningly calm
and collected when he phoned Mike to inquire about payment. Mike was in for a
lot, and without the expected bonus from that recent campaign, he didn&#8217;t even
have the money he&#8217;d put up, let alone enough to cover the juice Angelo was
already&nbsp;running.</p>
<p>Angelo had been more than happy to extend Mike&#8217;s repayment period; after
all, the interest went straight to his pocket. He had, of course, informed
Mike in no simple terms the extreme regret he&#8217;d feel if he didn&#8217;t pay the
money back when it was&nbsp;due.</p>
<p>Mike had readily agreed &#8211; he figured he could get the money somehow &#8211; he
would have done anything to get Angelo off his back for the time being. And
when the Richmond guys said they were looking at renewing their contract, Mike
was confident that the bonus would pay his debt and leave plenty left over for
a little celebration. As the bonus began to seem more and more a reality,
Angelo and the debt were demoted to the back corners of Mike&#8217;s&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
<p>But now, it was all he could think about. Mike didn&#8217;t know exactly what
Angelo was capable of, but he knew enough to worry. Angelo wasn&#8217;t the kind of
guy you could look up in the yellow pages. Mike had a need to be discreet
about his gambling; that&#8217;s why he went through Angelo in the first place. He
had never anticipated actually having Angelo hunt him&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>He couldn&#8217;t decide whether he should call Angelo and let him know he
wouldn&#8217;t have the money, or wait for Angelo to wonder where he was and send
someone for him. Either way, the outcome would be the same. He shook his head,
trying to shake off the uneasiness and worry that plagued him. Well, no matter
what, he was going home now. He was going to drink a large glass of scotch –
perhaps the whole bottle &#8211; and accept Marie&#8217;s soft, tender arms around his
neck to comfort him. And then, perhaps&#8230; well, he would have to&nbsp;wait.</p>
<p>Then he would figure out what to do. The alcohol and Marie would help to
calm him down; it would clear his head, it would make everything better. Then,
and only then, would he be able to make a rational decision, to do the right&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>As the train passed by the Allerton station, he looked out towards the
highway, hoping to catch a glimpse of his car. It wasn&#8217;t there. He sighed; it
had probably been towed to the city impound, which meant he&#8217;d have to pay to
get it back. It was surprising how quickly something as small as an impound
fee could become a financial&nbsp;burden.</p>
<p>The train pulled up to the far north station &#8211; his station &#8211; and he stood
up, head still swimming somewhat from his earlier bout with unconsciousness.
He phoned Marie as he stepped out of the nearly empty train; she still wasn&#8217;t
picking up. Her lack of attentiveness to his needs, whether she knew they
existed or not, was starting to wear on him. She was his wife, dammit! What
the hell was she&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p>The few cents in his pocket had not, unfortunately, transformed into more
during the trip, so he was still unable to afford a cab. He had no choice but
to continue on foot. He called Marie at about every block, but she never
answered. Eventually he started getting busy signals; was she there, and
simply ignoring him? That&nbsp;bitch!</p>
<p>The mile-long walk to his home went by quickly. He had too much on his mind
to feel the growing blisters on his feet, cramped inside the Italian leather
shoes; too much to feel the throbbing pain of the reopened wound on his hand,
now oozing blood&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The house was dark and quiet when he reached the front door. He grabbed his
key from his pocket, and inserted it into the deadbolt. As he pushed the key
in, the door swung open silently; it was unlocked. Something was wrong &#8211; the
door was never unlocked. Marie was obsessive about security &#8211; the only reason
the door would have been unlocked&nbsp;was&#8230;</p>
<p>He bolted into the room, looking around frantically. Nothing seemed out of&nbsp;place.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 9:&nbsp;Warning</strong></p>
<p>Ernie felt weak. His stomach hurt, his heart was racing, and all he could
think of was getting out of there. He wasn&#8217;t prepared to see a dead body, let
alone the body of someone he&nbsp;knew.</p>
<p>He turned and ran back out of the alley, leaving Ken scrambling to pick
himself off of the pavement and follow. Ernie didn&#8217;t go far. He ducked behind
the building at the end of the alley and sat down, back against the side of a
dumpster, and hugged his knees close to his&nbsp;chest.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t cry, but he felt like it. He couldn&#8217;t get the image out of his
head &#8211; Darryl, with his grimy face and bloody hands, lying there motionless on
the gurney, a twisted expression of fear on his face. At least his eyes had
been closed&#8230; Ernie shuddered&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Ken caught up with him, and assumed the same position as Ernie just to his&nbsp;left.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ern, what&#8217;s goin&#8217; on, man? You know that guy or somethin&#8217;?” Ernie
didn&#8217;t reply audibly, but nodded slightly. Ken knew him well enough to realize
that if you wanted information from Ernie, you were better off to just ask a
lot of&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>Ken hadn&#8217;t gotten a really good look at the man, since Ernie had dropped him
before his eyes could fully focus, but he knew Ernie didn&#8217;t know a whole lot
of people except the kids at the corner and the residents of St.&nbsp;Ives.</p>
<p>“Was is one of the guys from St. Ives, Ernie?” Ernie nodded ever so slightly
again. “Man, that sucks.” Ken leaned his head up against the dumpster, hugging
his knees even closer to his&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>A burst of inspiration struck Ken like a lightning bolt. This was a perfect
opportunity to do some sleuthing! Like many children, Ken vacillated when it
came to “what he wanted to do when he grew up.” But lately, he&#8217;d been leaning
towards the glorious life of a private eye, due in no small part to the
mystery novels that his friend Rex provided&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>He could use this opportunity to get some valuable experience. By
investigating the cause of the mystery man&#8217;s death, he could try out his
gumshoes and maybe even help Ernie somehow. It was an opportunity that
shouldn&#8217;t be&nbsp;missed.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ern, I&#8217;m going to head back to the store and see if I can figure out
what&#8217;s going on. Just stay here; I&#8217;ll be right&nbsp;back.”</p>
<p>Ernie was more than happy to stay right there. He was still feeling quite
sick. Sweat gathered quickly on his brow, and his breath became shallow. As
Ken scuttled back towards the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles,
Ernie&#8217;s mind cleared enough for him to think about what Darryl had told him a
few weeks&nbsp;previous.</p>
<p>Darryl was a regular at St. Ives, though he wasn&#8217;t there nearly as often as
Ernie. He was known by many of the other St. Ives residents as “the squeegee
man,” largely due to the fact that he spent his days down on State Avenue
cleaning the windshields of commuters as they waited at the lights. It
couldn&#8217;t be called a living, since he still made moderate use of St. Ive&#8217;s
free food supply, but he did better than many of the others who begged at
street corners or outside grocery&nbsp;stores.</p>
<p>Part of Darryl&#8217;s success was due to his easy smile and the fact that he
never <em>ever</em> asked for any money in return for his services. He strove to
make it appear that he was simply helping people out; he didn&#8217;t want people to
think he needed their charity, even though he most definitely&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>Darryl preferred instead to believe that people would pay for a service well
done, even though they didn&#8217;t necessarily know they needed the service. He
told Ernie on one occasion that most people didn&#8217;t realize how dirty their
windows really were until he&#8217;d cleaned them, and after that, they were more
than happy to throw a few cents his way in thanks. His attention to detail
certainly didn&#8217;t hurt his enterprise either; Darryl made sure your windows
were clean. This was not a cursory effort; this was professional service, even
if it did come from a grimy, off-smelling homeless&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>Ernie had accompanied Darryl one day, and initially he found it interesting,
but he didn&#8217;t excel at smalltalk and smiling the way Darryl did, and the
customers&#8217; looks of dismay upon their approach was more than enough to
convince Ernie that he was better off to stick to his&nbsp;jive.</p>
<p>He&#8217;d learned a lot from Darryl, though, especially about keeping a positive
attitude. Darryl had told Ernie stories of drivers that had gotten
particularly angry at him &#8211; so angry that they had stepped out of their cars
and gotten physical with him. Every so often, Ernie would see Darryl with
fresh bruises on his arms, or a cut above his eye. But he never let it get him
down. He had explained his philosophy to Ernie&nbsp;once.</p>
<p>“Ya see, Ernie, da way I figger it, everybody&#8217;s got a lot goin&#8217; on that we
don&#8217;t see. Take you and me, fer example. Most folks don&#8217;t realize you and me
ain&#8217;t gots no home, ain&#8217;t gots no food, but at the same time, we gots to
understand that they&#8217;se maybe had a rough day. Maybe da wife left ‘em and took
da kids. Maybe dey got fired an&#8217; worry about endin&#8217; up like you and me. I
dunno. But da point is, we don&#8217;t know. We gots to give them the opportunity to
be mad, cuz we don&#8217;t know why dey are. Maybe it&#8217;s me, but I don&#8217;t think so. I
think it&#8217;s something else. It&#8217;s like my momma used to always say, ‘Dey&#8217;s more
to it than just a broken&nbsp;leg.&#8217;”</p>
<p>Ernie had never quite understood what Darryl&#8217;s mother had meant, but if
Darryl&#8217;s account was at all truthful, she was the most intelligent and
insightful woman the earth had ever known, “a true angel,” as Darryl liked to&nbsp;say.</p>
<p>Ernie wasn&#8217;t sure if he and Darryl were friends or not, but he knew he
enjoyed his company, and whenever Darryl was at St. Ive&#8217;s, Ernie sought him&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Darryl had come to dinner at St. Ives a changed man. He was
bleeding from numerous cuts on his face, his clothes ripped and torn more than
usual, and his hands were blistered so he could barely hold the now broken&nbsp;squeegee.</p>
<p>Rhonda had clucked over him for an hour, dressing his wounds and cleaning
him up as best she could. Darryl was strangely reticent during the whole
procedure and on into the evening, despite Rhonda&#8217;s attempts to get him to
explain what had&nbsp;happened.</p>
<p>Ernie hadn&#8217;t had any luck either. He sat with Darryl at the dining room
table long after dinner, waiting for Darryl&#8217;s explanation, but it never came.
He just stared aimlessly into space, seemingly lost in his&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
<p>Finally, Ernie grew restless and stood up to leave, but Darryl had grasped
his arm&nbsp;urgently.</p>
<p>“Ernie, listen!” He spoke with an uncharacteristic urgency that immediately
caught Ernie&#8217;s attention. There was a bizarre fire in his eyes, but they
stared aimlessly the way they had that entire&nbsp;evening.</p>
<p>“If a man ever comes to you, sayin&#8217; he&#8217;s got da answer, dat he can get you
out, you just gots to do one thing, don&#8217;t listen to ‘im. Don&#8217;t let him take
‘vantage o&#8217; you. Tell him you&#8217;ll get out y&#8217;own way. Tell him you don&#8217;t need
‘im. Hear me?” He clenched Ernie&#8217;s arm so hard he cried out in&nbsp;surprise.</p>
<p>Ernie nodded a slow acknowledgment and drew his arm away quickly. Darryl had
never done anything that would hurt him before, but his eyes still stared off
aimlessly into space; he didn&#8217;t seem to even realize he&#8217;d done or said&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>Ernie had gone to bed that evening troubled, and he had wanted to ask Darryl
what he was talking about, but Darryl was gone in the morning. It wasn&#8217;t
unusual &#8211; Darryl often didn&#8217;t spend the whole night at the shelter. He
preferred to find his own place to sleep. But Darryl hadn&#8217;t returned, and no
one Ernie had spoken to had seen him around his normal Stae Avenue&nbsp;workplace.</p>
<p>Ernie hadn&#8217;t worried too much, though. Darryl was an old-timer; he&#8217;d been on
the street for a long time. He knew the ropes and could take care of&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>But now, seeing Darryl&#8217;s still body in the ambulance, the look of pain in
his eyes, Ernie wondered if perhaps there had been more to Darryl&#8217;s admonition
than he&#8217;d&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 10:&nbsp;Investigation </strong></p>
<p>Ken was having considerable luck on his first foray into the investigative
arts. He had quickly found a perfect listening post from a fire escape just
beyond the row of police cars and ambulances. From his vantage point, he could
get a relatively complete view of the mass of blue-suited officers with little
risk of being seen. And if he was quiet and listened carefully, he could make
out the conversations of them men below without too much&nbsp;difficulty.</p>
<p>Two men in trench coats and white dress shirts seemed to be running the
show. Ken had heard them be addressed as Detectives. Detective &#8211; that was a
title he could get used to. Detective van Zandt &#8211; yes, it had a nice ring to
it. This investigation stuff was going to be a&nbsp;blast!</p>
<p>Despite the fun he was having, Ken tried to keep a serious attitude. A man
<em>was</em> dead, and while that in and of itself wasn&#8217;t terribly stunning,
especially in McAllister Park , this was someone Ernie knew, and that made it
even more important that Ken take things seriously. He desperately wanted to
find out something that would put Ernie at ease, or at least give them a clue
as to what had happened. He&#8217;d never seen Ernie this way before, which meant
that he knew the dead man pretty&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>One of the detectives approached the ambulance where Darryl&#8217;s body lay. Ken
craned his neck to hear the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p>“Any idea who we&#8217;ve got&nbsp;here?”</p>
<p>“No, sorry. No identification at all. But judging from his appearance and
smell, he was probably homeless. We had more luck with the other guy. We found
a few books and some plane tickets from Sumatra in his backpack, and I think
somebody mentioned that they had his wallet as&nbsp;well.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, any idea on what&nbsp;happened?”</p>
<p>“Not really. Both victims had gunshot wounds, but judging from the blood
loss, I&#8217;d say John Doe over here got hit first. The kid probably stumbled on
the perps or tried to help the guy or something. A regular saint, I&nbsp;guess.”</p>
<p>“Where&#8217;s the other&nbsp;victim?”</p>
<p>“Well, they&#8217;ve got him on the train back up to Elston Memorial. Stomach
wound, but it seemed to have missed all the important stuff, so maybe he&#8217;ll be
all right. We&#8217;ll&nbsp;see.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, thanks.” The detective turned and walked towards his&nbsp;partner.</p>
<p>“What do we have,&nbsp;Cobb?”</p>
<p>“Looks like a homeless guy,” the first detective said, removing the
toothpick he&#8217;d been chewing on nervously from his&nbsp;mouth.</p>
<p>“Well, we&#8217;ve got the other guy&#8217;s wallet. His name is Joel Mendocino. Address
on his license is for an apartment just west of here. They&#8217;ve taken him to&nbsp;Elston.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that&#8217;s what I hear. Is Foster gonna call us when he&#8217;s awake so we can
get&nbsp;statement?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she said she&nbsp;would.”</p>
<p>“All right, let&#8217;s head to the apartment and see what we can find&nbsp;there.”</p>
<p>Ken watched as the two men headed on up the road towards their car, debating
whether the rest of the uniformed cops would have any useful information. None
of them seemed to be talking &#8211; they were all simply looking around the scene
and taking notes. He decided it was time to go let Ernie know what was going
on, and scrambled noiselessly off the fire escape and headed towards the
dumpster behind the alley, where Ernie was still sitting, head on his&nbsp;knees.</p>
<p>Ken pulled gently on his&nbsp;arm.</p>
<p>“Ernie, I found out where they&#8217;re taking the other guy. There were two of
‘em. Come on, lets go see if he can tell us anything.” He pulled more strongly
against Ernie&#8217;s&nbsp;resistance.</p>
<p>Ernie reluctantly stood up slowly and followed Ken to where his bike lay on
the asphalt. He didn&#8217;t much feel like “investigating,” but Ken seemed to think
it was the right thing to do. He instinctively reached for the headphones
around his neck, but stopped short of pulling them to his ears. No, he didn&#8217;t
feel much like jiving either, so he and Ken made their way up the street in&nbsp;silence.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 8: The Weakest&nbsp;Link</strong></p>
<p>The train didn&#8217;t seem to be moving as quickly as it had the last time he&#8217;d
ridden, mont hs ago. He was getting restless. The executives would be
expecting him momentarily. He glanced at his watch for the millionth time.
Time seemed to be slogging along at an incredibly slow&nbsp;rate.</p>
<p>The jagged cuts on his knuckles had stopped bleeding, and now pulsated a
dull pain through his entire right hand. He&#8217;d inadvertently gotten blood on
his fresh white shirt and dark tie; he probably wouldn&#8217;t have the time to
clean himself up before the meeting &#8211; if he even made&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Thee train creaked to a stop. Was this it? No, one more to go. He examined
his appearance in the low-contrast reflection of the train window. Wow, he was
a wreck; hair mussed up from the run, the gritty dull white powder of dried
sweat on his forehead, blood on his shirt, collar and tie loose and wrinkled.
He certainly didn&#8217;t look like a poster child for one of the most powerful
advertising firms in the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>A wave of anger passed over him, largely directed at Marie. After all, it
was <em>her</em> fault that all of this was happening. If she&#8217;d made sure he was up
this morning, he could have gotten on the road earlier. Granted, it was he
that was out late last night, but <em>that</em> was her fault too. If she&#8217;d kept him
satisfied, he wouldn&#8217;t have had the need to stay out late cheating on her to
satisfy his sexual appetite. See, it was all her fault. He ought to leave her.
Well, she&#8217;d be kissing the nice house in the Glade goodbye if he didn&#8217;t get
his bonus. At least this affected her as much as it affected him &#8211; she
wouldn&#8217;t get away&nbsp;scot-free.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity, the train finally made it to State
Avenue , and not a moment too soon. Mike grabbed his briefcase and hurried out
the door, pushing past the mob of people and ignoring their shouted protests
as he continued&nbsp;along.</p>
<p>The path along State Avenue to the tower was relatively clear; it was so
late in the morning, a majority of people had already made it to their jobs.
His previous physical activity had left his body reeling, and he was unable to
move faster than a brisk walk towards the tower. He pushed his way through the
revolving doors and ignored the pleasant greetings of the security guard as he
headed straight to the&nbsp;elevator.</p>
<p>He pressed the up button urgently, somehow feeling that the faster he
pressed it, the faster the elevator would descend. The pristine ding of the
elevator&#8217;s arrival could not come soon enough, and he boarded the car
anxiously. He was followed by two other nicely dressed individuals who ogled
his appearance as they boarded. He forced himself to smile smoothly, despite
his strong desire to rip their heads off. Who the hell did they think they&nbsp;were?</p>
<p>“34, please.” He murmured at the two other passengers as the doors slid to a
close with a hiss. A brief downward force signaled their ascent, and Mike
looked at his watch again. Shit, it was going to be close. The other
passengers departed at the 18 th floor, taking their time, much to Mike&#8217;s
chagrin. He pressed the door close button even more urgently than he had the
elevator call, and leaned back against the far elevator wall with an anxious
sigh. Fortunately for his sanity, it appeared no one else had any need to use
the elevator at this late morning hour, and his trip to the 34 th floor
continued&nbsp;uninterrupted.</p>
<p>The doors opened and Mike flew out frantically, briskly heading towards his
office to grab the collection of charts and mock-ups for the new&nbsp;campaign.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Turner, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here! They&#8217;re waiting for you in the
conference room! Oh my, are you all right? Do you&nbsp;need&#8230;”</p>
<p>“No, Susan, just let them know I am on my way right now. I&#8217;ll be there in a
minute.” He tightened his tie and buttoned the top button of his collar, then
quickly glanced at himself in the glass reflection of his office window. Well,
this was as good as it was going to get. He pulled the rolled posters from his
desk and walked towards the conference&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>He pushed the door to the conference room open with his back, and turned to
notice that a majority of the management staff was present. That was odd &#8211; he
thought this was just between Bill, his direct supervisor, a few of the other
executives, and himself. And what was Marlene doing here? She shouldn&#8217;t have
anything do with&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mike, glad you made it&#8230; Oh, are you all right? Do you need a few
minutes?” Bill stood in&nbsp;greeting.</p>
<p>“No, no, I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span>. I just cut my hand on my way over. No big&nbsp;deal.”</p>
<p>“Well, all right then. Go ahead and have a seat.” There was something
strange in his demeanor. He was too professional, too friendly. He and Mike
were barely on speaking terms &#8211; why the charade? And what were all these
<em>people</em> doing&nbsp;here?</p>
<p>“Mike, as you know, we&#8217;re here to talk about the Richmond&nbsp;account&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I&#8217;ve got some mock-ups here for you to look at.” Mike
interrupted in excitement. He was especially proud of his ideas for the new
campaign. They were quite possibly his best, and equipped with the right team,
he could really deliver the goods on this&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>He reached down for one of the rolled-up posters and began to unfold it. “As
you can see, I&#8217;ve totally rethought the logo and how it integrates with the
rest of the campaign, and I&#8217;ve got some&nbsp;new&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Well, Mike, let&#8217;s just wait on that. You see, we&#8217;ve had a lot of discussion
about the Richmond account, and as you know, they haven&#8217;t been pleased with
the latest campaign. We rely on their business, and we really need to pick up
the pace f we want to get them to sign a new&nbsp;con&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mike was annoyed. He already knew all of this. He knew how important the
account was, both to the company and his own career. Why did Bill have to
rehash all this stuff&nbsp;here?</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, Bill, which is why I&#8217;ve totally rethought our approach, and
if you&#8217;d just give me a second to&nbsp;exp&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Please Mike,” Bill said, holding up his hand and shaking his head. “Please
let me finish. We&#8230; all of us&#8230;” He motioned to the rest of those in the
room. “We&#8217;ve decided that we need some new leadership on the Richmond account.
Marlene, as you know, has a working relationship with some of the Richmond
guys from her days at Alliance , and we think that she might be able to
leverage that relationship to produce some good&nbsp;results.”</p>
<p>Well, that explained Marlene&#8217;s presence. “What the hell is going on, Bill?
Are you letting me go?” Mike could feel himself getting&nbsp;hot.</p>
<p>“In a word Mike&#8230; yes.” That son of a bitch. He looked around the room at
the rest of the observers. They all averted their gazes, looking at the floor
or out the window. Was this really&nbsp;happening?</p>
<p>He stood up suddenly, causing a gasp to ripple through the rest of those
present. Marlene pushed away from the table quickly. Bill stood up to meet
him, a nervous look on his face. He moved his hands slowly, obviously trying
to calm the&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>“Now Mike, settle&nbsp;down&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mike didn&#8217;t want to settle down. He didn&#8217;t want to calm the situation. He
<em>wanted</em> to rip into&nbsp;someone.</p>
<p>“This is why you called me down here, Bill? This is the meeting you told me
about <em>two weeks</em> ago? This is what I&#8217;ve been preparing for, spending late
nights in this fucking office, cultivating and developing what is quite
possibly the most brilliant idea this firm has ever had? You son of a&nbsp;bitch!”</p>
<p>Mike advanced towards Bill. There was too much going through his head. He
couldn&#8217;t think everything through. His blood was boiling! Did they honestly
think that Marlene, that <em>bitch</em>, was going to be able to take over for him?
He was the heart of this company &#8211; Richmond was his account! What the hell
were they&nbsp;doing?</p>
<p>Bill backed away slowly, still moving his arms in a vain attempt to calm
Mike&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>“Come on Mike, you have to&nbsp;understand&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What?” Mike shouted. He was pissed now. “What do I have to understand,
Bill? Do you really think this little cunt can take the Richmond account?”
There was no answer. “Fine. Let her try!” With a roar, Mike turned and slammed
his right fist into the wall. Pain shot like hot needles through his arm, but
he didn&#8217;t&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>He turned back to where his briefcase and posters sat, leaving a streak of
maroon conspicuously on the cream conference room wall. Someone must have
called the tower security; two hefty-looking gentlemen stood in the doorway&nbsp;stolidly.</p>
<p>“Mike,” started Bill again, as Mike began to pick up his briefcase and mock-
ups. With mock-ups like these, he&#8217;d at least be able to get another&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>“Leave the stuff here. You know you can&#8217;t take it with&nbsp;you.”</p>
<p>Shit, he was right. Nothing Mike had done while working at the company was
his &#8211; it all belonged to Copeland. Those sons of bitches. He now understood
why they&#8217;d waited to tell him they&#8217;d decided to fire him; they knew he&#8217;d put
all of his energy into revamping the campaign if he thought he had an
opportunity to really change it. Now they could take his work, give it to
Marlene, and turn it into a money-making campaign. And all it cost them was
his severance&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re all sons of bitches, you know that?” He dropped the posters and
briefcase as the two stolid gentlemen grabbed his arms and led him towards the
elevators. His rage continued to mount as the elevator descended. He
considered his options. He could try to take out the two security men and go
on a rampage through the office, but sadly, he had no weapons. The men looked
pretty solid, anyway; he wouldn&#8217;t be able to take both of them&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>This sucked. No amount of profanity murmured under his breath could fully
express the sense of betrayal he felt. As the security men dragged him out of
the elevator on the ground floor, a sudden weight fell down on him. The
adrenaline that his anger had brought forth unexpectedly dissipated, and he
felt light-headed. The last thing he saw before passing out was two delivery
men wheeling a large cake through the tower lobby. The icing read,
“Congratulations&nbsp;Marlene!”</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 7:&nbsp;Shopping </strong></p>
<p>Angela ran up and down the aisles, shrieking gleefully at each brightly
colored box of food that she did not recall being there the week before.
Melissa pushed the now overflowing cart behind her rambunctious daughter,
ignoring the disapproving stares of the store employees and other customers.
She&#8217;d grown accustomed to them over the&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>“Can we get this, please?” Angela asked, throwing yet another box into the
cart before turning around quickly and running back to grab more useless
products, pony tail bobbing happily. Melissa sighed again. If she could get
paid a nickel, or even just a <em>penny</em>, for every sigh she&#8217;d uttered since
Angela&#8217;s&nbsp;birth&#8230;</p>
<p>Melissa could hardly wait until Angela was old enough to start dating. That
hellion would eat a boy for breakfast! Melissa nearly laughed out loud at the
thought of some boy seeking Angela&#8217;s affections, standing at the door with
flowers, nervous upon meeting his date&#8217;s father. Melissa chuckled again.
Someone frightened of Lawrence , ha! Whatever boy wanted to date Angela would
be in for a surprise, that was for sure. If he could handle <em>her</em>, then the
rest of the family would be a piece of&nbsp;cake.</p>
<p>Melissa shook her head sternly as Angela rounded the corner with a new box
in her hand. A shadow fell across the five-year-old&#8217;s face. The fun and games
were over, it seemed. Melissa motioned with her finger, maintaining the stern
expression on her&nbsp;face.</p>
<p>“Come on, Angie. I told you you had to settle down, and you haven&#8217;t. Come
on, up in the cart.” She motioned towards the toddler seat in the overloaded&nbsp;cart.</p>
<p>“But Mommy, I&#8217;m not a baby anymore,” Angela replied, putting on her best
pouting face. She looked pitiful, but Melissa was not falling for the act.
Lawrence might, but she was tougher than he, especially when it came to their&nbsp;daughter.</p>
<p>“Well, you certainly seem to <em>act</em> like a baby, so I think you can ride
like a baby. Come on, up you go.” She lifted the girl and placed her in the
seat. Angela crossed her arms across her chest and forced her frown to become
even more pronounced. It was comical. The entire store seemed to erupt in
silent applause at the site of the annoying blonde trapped in the toddler&nbsp;chair.</p>
<p>Melissa pushed the cart along each aisle, silently replacing each item that
Angela had placed in the cart, ignoring the small whimpers escaping her mouth
at the loss of each incredibly important item. The rest of the excursion would
transpire in silence, since Angela&#8217;s method of retribution when wronged was to
keep her mouth shut. Lawrence hated it. If he&#8217;d made her angry, he&#8217;d spend the
next hour trying to get her to talk to him, but Melissa simply ignored her.
Making her angry was often the only way to get her to shut up&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>At last the final one of Angela&#8217;s contributions to the day&#8217;s purchases was
replaced on the shelf, and Melissa double checked her short list to ensure
that she had found everything she needed. The cart seemed sparse after
removing all the superfluous items, but she had everything she needed.
Surveying the surrounding aisles quickly for any last-minute things she might
have forgotten, she turned the cart briskly and strode towards the checkout
lines, which were overpopulated with&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, Angela, you can have one small thing &#8211; just one. What do you&nbsp;want?”</p>
<p>The girl didn&#8217;t respond. Apparently she was still angry. Melissa shook her
head and sighed. It was her&nbsp;loss.</p>
<p>She peered around the register lanes, looking for Ned, the nice man who
always helped her to the car and always said something kind to Angela. There
he was, ringing up a constant stream of customers, as usual. The wait in his
line would be worth it. She could use a pick-me-up&nbsp;today.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ned was back in his groove. The brief break earlier had really rejuvenated
him, and he&#8217;d been visited by several of his regular customers already today,
which kept him feeling good. The pain in his knee had grown duller, and while
still present, was&nbsp;bearable.</p>
<p>He was scanning items more efficiently than he had in awhile, passing item
after item quickly over the glowing red bars of the <span class="caps">UPC</span> scanner. He had
explained once to some of the other cashiers how the scanning machine worked.
They all were amazed at his knowledge, and for a brief shining moment, he had
felt like he was himself again. A smart, respected engineer, whose knowledge
of mechanical and electrical machines was belied by his soft eyes and quiet&nbsp;demeanor.</p>
<p>Of course, Bob had quickly disbanded the small group of listeners to Ned&#8217;s
explanation, somehow turning a <span class="caps">UPC</span> scanner into a major character in the
latest episode of his corporate kiss-ass saga. Holly had been kind enough to
listen to his further explanation during one of their mutual breaks. She had
seemed genuinely interested, though Ned knew she had promptly forgotten
everything he&#8217;d said. It didn&#8217;t matter. She&#8217;d given him the chance to feel
smart and useful again, and that was what he&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>Ned often spent his breaks chatting with Holly when he could. They often sat
out on bench in the parking lot, while Holly smoked a cigarette. She never
failed to offer one to Ned, though he always declined. Truth be told, he found
the habit disgusting and repulsive, but Holly was interesting to be around,
and her presence offset the acrid smell of the smoke. In fact, there were
several things that Ned disapproved of about Holly, and if she had been his
daughter, they certainly would have a lot to discuss. But she wasn&#8217;t his
daughter, and as their work relationship turned into a true friendship, he
found that the eyebrow piercing and smoking habit defined their relationship
less and&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>He was constantly astounded by her generosity. She often invited the beggars
standing outside to join her for a snack, and always listened to their stories
of heartache and longing. That was her real gift to them, whether they
realized it or not &#8211; the gift of a listening, interested ear. Anyone could
give them a piece of pizza or the loose change in their pocket, but Holly&#8217;s
genuine concern for them and inquiries about their well-being lasted longer
than both the food and the loose&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>Ned knew that many of the homeless men and women that frequented the area
surrounding the store were residents, either permanent or otherwise, of the
St. Ives shelter. He had mentioned to Holly that she should consider
volunteering there or something, but she seemed reluctant. She always just
smiled and said, “Yeah, Ned, I know,” but to his knowledge, she never had even
set foot in the&nbsp;shelter.</p>
<p>He shot a glance to register 7, where Holly was now busy ringing up her own
long line of customers. She caught his glance and smiled. He smiled back. He
might hate his job, but at least he had to opportunity to become friends with
good&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot, Ned. I&#8217;ll see you next&nbsp;week.”</p>
<p>“You too, Mark. Be careful on the way out, it&#8217;s a bit slick by the door,” he
replied, referring to the small puddle of soda, remnants of an overactive
bottle of&nbsp;Sprite.</p>
<p>He looked up to identify his next customer, and groaned inwardly as he saw
Melissa and Angela. Melissa was nice enough, but her daughter was a brat. Ned
had seen the way Melissa and Lawrence doted on her every whim, and it made him
sick. If _she&#8217;d _ been his daughter &#8211; well, he was just glad she wasn&#8217;t. He&#8217;d
have picked Holly over her any&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>“Hi, Ned! How&#8217;ve you been?” Melissa inquired cheerfully, her smile
contradicted by the obvious tension and exhaustion in her&nbsp;voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, I&#8217;m fine, fine. And your&nbsp;husband?”</p>
<p>“He had to work today. It&#8217;s just me and&nbsp;Angie.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. And how are you, little miss?” He smiled, eyes peeking over the
edge of his nose at the girl who looked very angry, arms crossed defiantly
across her&nbsp;chest.</p>
<p>“Fine,” she replied, not looking&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>He began to scan the items on the small conveyor belt. He knew that would
get Angie&#8217;s attention. She was always intrigued by the speed at which he
loaded the bags, so much faster than any other&nbsp;cashier.</p>
<p>Today was no exception. As the <em>beep</em>, <em>beep</em>, <em>beep</em>, of the scanned
items reverberated in the echoic store, Angela became transfixed on Ned&#8217;s
hands. They seemed to blur as he scanned and bagged each item with lightning&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>Ned grinned at her, willing his arms to move even faster, mentally
confirming that every item had scanned by carefully listening for the
confirmation beep. He was going <em>fast</em>&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his hands faltered. The jar of peanut butter, fortunately
plastic, flew from his fingers and clattered loudly on the tiled floor. The
store seemed to freeze; the all of the customers&#8217; attention was focused on
him, and him&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p>The silence was broken by Angela&#8217;s childish laughter. She clapped her hands
with glee, apparently deriving some sadistic pleasure from Ned&#8217;s mistake. Ned,
speechless at this unexpected development, knelt down silently and picked up
the jar. He scanned it again and continued, moving more slowly and del
iberately this&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The rest of the store reanimated itself, and Ned glanced up again to see
Holly still looking his direction. Her eyes asked, “Are you <span class="caps">OK</span>?” He nodded
back at her and painted his smile back on before looking back up at&nbsp;Melissa.</p>
<p>“Well, will there be anything else for you this&nbsp;morning?”</p>
<p>“No, Ned, that&#8217;ll be all. How much do I owe&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>“Well, you owe me a smile, but the store will want $87.13.” Ned joked back,
trying to shake off the embarrassment he felt at having dropped the peanut
butter. Melissa&nbsp;grinned.</p>
<p>“Well, here&#8217;s your smile, and here&#8217;s the check for the store. Can I trust
you to make sure they get&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p>“But of course,” he replied. “Would you like some help getting out to your&nbsp;car?”</p>
<p>“Well&#8230; Actually, yes, that&#8217;d be&nbsp;great.”</p>
<p>Ned glanced around, looking for one of the young cart collectors to help
Melissa, but there were none to be found. Oh well. “I&#8217;ll be right back,
everyone.” He flipped the light on his register off and limped along behind
Melissa to her car, ignoring the faces Angela made at him as they walked. He&#8217;d
be glad when they were gone, especially the little&nbsp;brat.</p>
<p>Melissa opened the trunk and Ned quickly loaded the bags into it with his
strong arms, oblivious to the sound of sirens as they passed along the street
in front of the&nbsp;store.</p>
