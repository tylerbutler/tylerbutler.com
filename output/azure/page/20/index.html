                                    <p>Imagine my surprise when I was browsing my feeds at Google Reader today to see
the word &#8220;Pidgin&#8221; in my feeds. And in a Lifehacker post, no less! To
understand why I would be surprised, you have to remember that I grew up in
Papua New Guinea, where a trade language called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tok_Pisin">Neo-Melanesian Pidgin</a>
(Tok Pisin in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular">vernacular</a>) is spoken by roughly 4 million people
there. It is commonly referred to as just &#8220;pidgin&#8221; by people that live in&nbsp;<span class="caps">PNG</span>.</p>
<p>In reality, pidgin is a generic linguistic term that refers to a language that
develops as a means to facilitate trade in areas where many different
languages are spoken by small people groups. Since ~850 languages are spoken
in <span class="caps">PNG</span>, it makes some sense that a pidgin would be born to facilitate trade
and communication. Neo-Melanesian pidgin is based on English and German. One
of the defining characteristics of pidgins is that they are typically just a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">lingua franca</a>, and not spoken as a first language by any people group.
Pidgins sometimes develop into creoles, which means that they then become more
full-fledged languages, because people learn to speak them as their first (and
sometimes only) language. This is the case with Haitian Creole (originally a
French Pidgin, now a French&nbsp;Creole).</p>
<p>Anyhow, the Pidgin Lifehacker was talking about is an <span class="caps">IM</span> client, much like
Trillian. Not quite what I was expecting, but given what a pidgin is, the name
is fitting.&nbsp;:-)</p>

says they&#8217;ll be working on a Linux port of Silverlight in the future. Sweet! I
was personally annoyed to find out that &#8220;cross-platform&#8221; only meant Mac and
Windows when Silverlight was officially announced. But it&#8217;s nice to see Mono
committing to filling the Linux gap. Best of luck to&nbsp;them!</p>

                                    <p>I&#8217;ve been avoiding services like Facebook, MySpace, Friendster and the like
for a long time despite their growing popularity. In the MySpace case, it&#8217;s a
philosophical choice &#8211; MySpace sites are often so bad! They look horrible,
music plays when you go to them, the formatting is terrible… This is a natural
outcome of pure freedom; when you allow people to customize things and make
them look exactly like they want, you give them the freedom to make horrible
looking stuff. But I&#8217;m getting a bit off topic… Anyway, I avoid MySpace sort
of on principal, but I avoid Facebook due to some other reasons that I think
finally crystallized in my mind while attending a roundtable discussion at <span class="caps">MIX</span>
that included folks from Six Apart, Twitter, and&nbsp;Facebook.</p>
<p>The guy from Facebook was talking about how they view Facebook as being not an
<em>extension</em> of your identity, but rather a <em>representation</em> of it (my words,
not his; I&#8217;m trying to paraphrase the conversation). In other words, your
Facebook simply reflects the things that are happening to you, what&#8217;s going on
in your life, etc., and then shortens the gap between those events and
occurrences and the people that potentially care about you. Their philosophy
as I understand it is to reduce the amount of overhead that comes with keeping
track of what&#8217;s going on with&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a noble goal, I suppose, and one I can certainly appreciate given that
I have friends strewn all over the world (ever since the great Diaspora that
was my high school graduation in <span class="caps">PNG</span>). It certainly would be nice to always
know what was happening with those folks without ever having to do anything
about it. But I think that&#8217;s the crux of my opposition to&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>You see, I think there is a great deal of worth in getting an email after a
long time from someone who has taken the time to write you and give you a
brief update about them. It took time and energy for them to write you and
update you on their life &#8211; and I believe it shows they care. This type of rich
interaction with someone occurs more naturally after a time out of&nbsp;touch.</p>
<p>Imagine a 30-year high-school reunion if everyone was on Facebook the entire
time after graduation? Would there be anything to talk about? I suppose the
conversation would revolve around politics, religion, and other matters of
<em>opinion</em>, because life events would simply be old news. Everyone would
already know that Sam got married last summer and Mary got a new job. There&#8217;d
be no excitement in learning that Joe&#8217;s son spoke his first words last week or
that Sally was finally able to get that surgery she&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re always connected to one another all the time, it removes the
excitement and enjoyment that comes from the <em>re</em>-connecting after a
disconnect. It&#8217;s cliché, to be sure, but absence makes the heart grow fonder,
and for that reason, Facebook&#8217;s just not for&nbsp;me.</p>

                                    <p>My session went pretty well yesterday, but unfortunately I had quite a few
demo issues. The session before mine went late, which made me pressed for time
to get things plugged up and ready to go. The first problem was that they
didn&#8217;t have my presentation pre-loaded on the presentation computer. So I
spent a few minutes looking for it, and then finally gave up, plugged in my
<span class="caps">USB</span> key to the back of the machine and just loaded it. Problem 1 solved, but
it got my nerves in a bit of a tizzy so I didn&#8217;t quite start with the bang I
wanted&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>The A/V guy thought I was ready to go as soon as the presentation was up and so
started everything, but I didn&#8217;t get a chance to double check that my demo
laptop was working properly and that the demos were going to be displayed
correctly. <em>Big mistake.</em> When it came time to do my demos, I couldn&#8217;t get any
signal from the laptop to the displays. I fiddled with it for what seemed like
an eternity, but in the end made the executive decision to just continue on so
I could make it through the core content. One problem with doing demos from
Vista machines is that I can never freaking find the right place to look to
change settings. It&#8217;s <em>very</em> frustrating, and when you&#8217;re nervous or anxious,
it just makes matters worse. For the demos I just did my best to explain the
points in the demos verbally, but of course that was a very poor&nbsp;substitute.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, I offered to show the demos on my laptop after the
talk for those that were interested. However, there were a number of
questions, and due to the wait and inactivity, Virtual <span class="caps">PC</span> stopped cooperating
and I couldn&#8217;t get anything to display on the demo box. &lt;sigh></p>
<p>For those of you who were at my session, please accept my sincere apologies
for the lack of demos. I had a much better, more cohesive presentation
planned. Hopefully the extended Q&amp;A was useful. Judging from the number of
great questions and business cards I got for follow up info, people still got
something out of the&nbsp;session.</p>
<p>I will be at the Mix Chat and attending various sessions throughout the rest
of the conference. If you want to chat with me, catch up with me at the
conference, or send me an email to set up some time to talk while we&#8217;re&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>I was very serious when I said that I&#8217;d like to start conversations with
everybody about their SharePoint experiences. We very much want to understand
where you perceive the problems to be so that we can address them. Believe it
or not, it&#8217;s not always as obvious to us as it is to you what we should do. So
we very much value your&nbsp;feedback!</p>
