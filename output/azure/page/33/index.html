                                    <p><strong>Chapter 21: The&nbsp;Mark</strong></p>
<p>Ames and Cobb were excited. Joel had been able to give them a description,
albeit a rather poor one, but he&#8217;d also been able to give them a rough sketch
of the tattoo the man had on his hand, and <em>that</em> was something that they
could look&nbsp;into.</p>
<p>They ignored the dagger-like stares of Joel&#8217;s parents as they stood up
quickly, their movements taking on an almost frenzied speed, and rushed out of
the room, murmuring thanks to Joel as they went. Joel was just glad to be rid
of them. The pain had returned, and he was overcome with weakness again. Sleep
overcame him as Karen wordlessly maneuvered the notebook from his hands and
walked briskly out of the room, trying to catch up to Ames and&nbsp;Cobb.</p>
<p>Ames had a feeling that he had seen the mark before, but he couldn&#8217;t
remember where. Maybe if he looked at it again&#8230; Wait, where was the&nbsp;sketch?</p>
<p>“Damn it, Cobb, we forgot the sketch.” They both turned and nearly bowled
over a panting Karen, who thrust the note book at them. Cobb and Ames smiled.
“Thanks Karen. See you back at the&nbsp;station.”</p>
<p>They turned and continued out of the hospital and on to their car. Ames took
the passenger seat and examined the sketch more closely as Cobb started the
engine and headed out of the parking lot, turning towards the&nbsp;station.</p>
<p>“Recognize something, Ames ? ” Cobb asked, amused at his partner&#8217;s look of
complete perplexity as he peered at the&nbsp;sketch.</p>
<p>Ames sighed and reluctantly moved his eyes away from the sketch. “I dunno.
It looks so familiar.” He shook his head. “But I can&#8217;t put my finger on it
right now.” He rubbed his eyes and leaned his head back against the&nbsp;headrest.</p>
<p>“What a day. I&#8217;ll be glad when we can get some rest. What time is it,&nbsp;anyway?”</p>
<p>Cobb glanced at the green clock in the dash. “&#8217;Bout 4:30,” he said. “No rest
‘til we get this thing straightened out though &#8211; I&#8217;ve got a feeling we&#8217;re on
to something. We need to finish this out as soon as we can. This is a make-it-
or-break-it case for us, you&nbsp;know?”</p>
<p>Ames gave a low snore as a response, and Cobb smiled. Might as well let him
sleep for the few minutes it would take them to get to the station. It would
hopefully clear his head enough to help him remember where he&#8217;d seen the
tattoo&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The station was clearing out when they arrived. It was quitting time for
many of the administrative workers, and the parking lot was becoming deserted
as they pulled&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Their first stop was Foster&#8217;s office. She was on the phone when they&nbsp;entered.</p>
<p>“I understand that, Mrs. Mendocino. I will speak to them. Of course. If you
have any other concerns, please just give me a call. I know&#8230; you&#8217;ll be the
first to know. And if your son happens to think of anything else, please let
us know. <span class="caps">OK</span>, you have a nice day, and I am sorry about your son&#8230; Bye&nbsp;bye.”</p>
<p>Foster exhaled slowly as she laid the handset down. “That was Joel
Mendocino&#8217;s mother. She was upset because you stormed in and disturbed her
son.” She looked up at them pleadingly. “Was it really necessary to barge in
there like you&nbsp;did?”</p>
<p>“We ran into a complete dead end, Lieu. We figgered the kid could probably
give us more information than he already had, and based on other things we
were able to find out, we think this case may be bigger than just a simple&nbsp;mugging.”</p>
<p>“Really? What have you&nbsp;found?”</p>
<p>Both Cobb and Ames pulled out their notebooks, scanning the cluttered pages
for reminders of the day&#8217;s conversations. “Well, we got confirmation that the
dead victim <em>is</em> homeless. His name is Darryl; we weren&#8217;t able to get a last
name. He&#8217;s in and out of St. Ives, a homeless shelter down around McAllister
Park&nbsp;.”</p>
<p>Ames continued, “We went and talked to a number of homeless people in the
area, especially down on 59 th , and they all told us stories of some
‘abductions,&#8217; for lack of a better word, of homeless people these lat few
weeks. Seems they all show up a day later, all beat up. Apparently it happened
to Darryl, but no one we spoke to could tell us if it somehow related to his&nbsp;death.”</p>
<p>Ames paused, and Cobb interjected again. “Both of us feel like the
abductions and Darryl&#8217;s death are related, but we&#8217;re not sure how&nbsp;yet&#8230;”</p>
<p>“But this,” Ames said, slamming the sketchbook down on Foster&#8217;s desk
excitedly. “May be the link between everything. Joel Mendocino was able to
sketch this for us. He said that the man who&#8217;d shot him had that symbol
tattooed on his&nbsp;hand.”</p>
<p>Foster held the sketch up to the light, examining it more closely. She
frowned. “You said there have been a lot of abductions&nbsp;lately?”</p>
<p>Ames nodded. “Is it possible that Darryl told someone a little too much
about his experience and they had to have him&nbsp;killed?”</p>
<p>Cobb smiled. “That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re&nbsp;thinking.”</p>
<p>“Well, check with Organized Crime,” Foster said, handing the sketch back to
Ames . “See if the sketch rings any bells with them. If these abductions are
related, then there&#8217;s probably a kingpin involved somewhere along the line. <span class="caps">OC</span>
might know something about&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>Ames and Cobb nodded before turning and exiting the office, walking to their
own desks in the main office. The station was still populated, but the usual
bustle of the day had calmed down substantially since everyone had gone&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>Cobb picked up his phone and dialed the extension for the Organized Crime
division as Ames headed back towards the records room. “Hi, this is Detective
Cobb from Homicide. We got a victim over here, homeless man, possibly related
to a rash of abductions and assaults that&#8217;s been happening recently in the
McAllister Park area. One of the shooters had a mark on his hand. We&#8217;ve got a
sketch, and we were wondering if you guys could take a look and see if you
recognize it. Sure. <span class="caps">OK</span>, I&#8217;ll do it right&nbsp;now.”</p>
<p>He out down the receiver. “They want me to fax it over.” He walked over to
the fax machine and fed the paper quickly through. Ames returned carrying a
stack of folders and sat down, poring through&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>“These are reports from some of the other assaults that have been reported
by hospitals recently. Most of them are from McAllister Park , which isn&#8217;t
surprising in and of itself, but here&#8217;s something interesting. There are other
reports of assault-like wounds from some middle-aged businessmen from the same
day or the day following the same report from a homeless man.&nbsp;Coincidence?”</p>
<p>Cobb glanced over Ames &#8216; shoulder at the cluttered data in front of them.
“So what are you&nbsp;thinking?”</p>
<p>“I dunno. But it seems strange to me that a bunch of businessmen get beat
up, and a bunch of homeless men get beat up, all at the same time, and nobody
wants to press charges or talk about it. Hell, a lot of them made excuses
like, ‘I fell down the stairs,&#8217; or some bullshit like&nbsp;that.”</p>
<p>The phone rang, shattering their contemplation. Cobb picked up. “This is
Cobb. Uh-huh. Really? So soon, huh? Great. Yeah, fax it over. You say there&#8217;s
a unit over in the area right now? <span class="caps">OK</span>, yeah, I&#8217;ll do that. <span class="caps">OK</span>, thanks a lot.&nbsp;Bye.”</p>
<p>Ames looked up from his reading&nbsp;excitedly.</p>
<p>“Well, we got a match,” Cobb said, walking over to the fax machine, where a
copy of a police report was spitting out. “The <span class="caps">OC</span> guys said there&#8217;s an
warehouse over on Delome that has been investigated by some blue and whites
for the past couple of weeks. A woman has been calling to complain about noise
coming from it for awhile, but by the time the blue and whites get out there,
there&#8217;s nothing to be&nbsp;seen.”</p>
<p>“But how does this tie into the tattoo, and what does <span class="caps">OC</span> have to do with it?
And furthermore, what&#8217;s a woman doing <em>living</em> down on&nbsp;Delome?”</p>
<p>Cobb chuckled. The old industrial section of the city centered around Delome
Avenue , and it was generally considered to be one of the worst places in the
city to live, but some residents refused to&nbsp;move.</p>
<p>“Well, <span class="caps">OC</span> started looking into it because there was a major <span class="caps">OC</span>-related drug
bust around the area, and they&#8217;re thinking the entire area is probably used by
gangs and whatnot for all kinds of nefarious activities. So they had a few of
their guys look into it, and he remembers seeing a symbol sort of like the
tattoo on the shooter&#8217;s hand etched into a door on one of the warehouses. They
sent a blue and white out there tonight to keep an eye on things, and see if
they could figure out what&#8217;s going on. What do you say we join&nbsp;‘em.”</p>
<p>“Worth a shot, I guess. Strange that a mark like that would be etched in a
door, but whatever. Thank God for small miracles, I suppose. Let&#8217;s&nbsp;go.”</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 22:&nbsp;Disappearance</strong></p>
<p>The silence that had followed James&#8217; story was finally broken by Holly&#8217;s
expression of thanks. She stood up slowly, reaching her hand towards the
grizzled&nbsp;storyteller.</p>
<p>“Thank you, James, for telling us about&nbsp;this.”</p>
<p>“Wal, I figgered somebody oughtta know. Somethin&#8217;s got to be done, I think.
I mean, most folks don&#8217;t seem to care too much about us down here, but still,
it just ain&#8217;t right for us to get kidnapped and beat up like we do. Anyway, I
hope maybe you all can tell the right&nbsp;people&#8230;”</p>
<p>Holly smiled as she released his hand. Ned nodded in acknowledgement and
thanks as he and Holly turned around, looking for Ned and Ken. They weren&#8217;t
sitting behind them where they had been initially. Where had they&nbsp;gone?</p>
<p>Holly glanced around frantically and began to call Ernie&#8217;s name. Ned calmed
her down. “Holly&#8230; maybe they&#8217;ve just gone to the van&#8230; let&#8217;s just go and
look.” He took her hand and led her towards the van. Holly wasn&#8217;t calm. The
stress of the day was finally catching up to her. She needed a stiff drink –
<em>very</em>&nbsp;stiff.</p>
<p>And now Ernie had disappeared! Her emotional side had taken over, leaving
rationality by the wayside, and Ned&#8217;s confidence was not as comforting as it
ordinarily was. She continued to look around as Ned dragged her towards the
van, and called Ernie&#8217;s name at increasing volume even after they had left the
bounds of the bridge&nbsp;community.</p>
<p>Ned, unlike Holly, still had a sense of rationality despite the straining
and confusing events of the day. Perhaps it was the fact that he was an
engineer, a professional, perhaps it was that he was male, but whatever the
reason, he was dealing with the situation as calmly and coolly as could be&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>Upon their arrival at the van, he peered around, looking for signs of Ernie
and Ken both in and around the vehicle, but he found none. And Ken&#8217;s bike
wasn&#8217;t in the back. His initial reason for going to the van was to see if the
bike was still there, but upon inspection, he remembered that Ken had insisted
that he remove it when they had arrived. Holly was growing increasingly
agitated, allowing the worry of her maternal instinct get the best of&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>“Holly! Cal m down! I am going to go back and see if they went to the east
side of the bridge. I&#8217;ll be back in a few minutes. You wait here in case they
come back.&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>?”</p>
<p>Holly nodded reluctantly in response. Ned made sure she was comfortable in
the passenger seat of the van, then turned and walked back towards the bridge.
He made his rounds, following roughly the same path that the quartet had made
earlier in the day, but no one had seen Ernie or Ken for quite some time. Some
people reported seeing them ride off on the bike about 45 minutes ago, so
Ned&#8217;s suspicion that they had left of their own accord was satisfactorily&nbsp;answered.</p>
<p>He returned to the van and continued to try and calm Holly, reassuring her
that both Ernie and Ken were not stupid, that they knew this area of town
well, that they had most likely ridden home on their own; they were&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>Holly didn&#8217;t seem to believe him, but she reluctantly calmed down and agreed
that they should drive home. She could call St. Ives from home and make sure
Ernie was back. Ned was glad when he finally spun the wheel and maneuvered his
way back onto the road. He wanted to get home and have a stiff drink&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>When he reached Holly&#8217;s small apartment, he debated whether or not to leave
her alone. She had calmed down considerably during the trip, and assured him
that she&#8217;d be fine. If she felt she needed anything, she&#8217;d call him and let
him know. She exited the van and waved half-heartedly as she opened the door
to her apartment building and&nbsp;entered.</p>
<p>Ned felt like he needed to calm his nerves, and driving had always been a
good way to do that, so he decided to take the long route home. His mind
wandered back to his homeland as he&nbsp;drove.</p>
<p>One of the core reasons that he and Lavina had emigrated to America was to
escape the violence that had plagued their country. Thankfully, neither Ned
nor Lavina had ever experienced the violence firsthand, but they had heard
terrible stories of roving “death gangs” that would travel around, raping,
beating and robbing anyone who got in their path. If they didn&#8217;t physically
kill you, they&#8217;d do enough psychological damage that it was essen tially the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>Ned shook his head. America was not the land of promise that he had hoped
and dreamed it would be when he had contemplated the move from his European
home. America was no better than the rest of the world &#8211; it had the same
vices, the same violence and depravity, the same distaste for the less
fortunate. No, America was not the land he had been&nbsp;promised.</p>
<p>He approached the small house that his family called home and parked the van
on the street on the next block. His six children poured out of the front door
of the house, the older ones smiling in warm welcome, the youngest running up
to him and attaching themselves steadfastly to his legs. It had been an entire
day! How had they <em>ever</em> gotten along without&nbsp;him?</p>
<p>He walked, children in tow, towards their home. Lavina stood in the doorway,
a strange expression of disapproval on her round face. Ned entered the house
and hugged her close, ignoring the children&#8217;s burst of laughter as he swept
her back and kissed her fiercely on the lips. What a wonderful family they had
created &#8211;&nbsp;together!</p>
<p>But it soon became apparent that Lavina was not in the mood to revel in the
marvelous nature of their family. She pushed him away and said, “Someone is on
the phone for you. Young and she sounds&nbsp;upset.”</p>
<p>Ned sighed. Lavina had so many astonishing qualities, but she was jealous.
She thought that every young America n girl was on a personal mission to steal
her husband away, and she fought fiercely for her man, though Ned knew <em>that</em>
battle had been won long, long&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>He walked into the small living room, sitting down heavily on the chair that
was his. The children did try, on many occasions, to claim it for themselves,
but it was well acknowledged among all members of the family that when Ned was
home, the chair was <em>his</em>, and no one&nbsp;else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He was looking forward to a few minutes of relaxation on the chair, then it
would be time to do something really fun &#8211; work on the Jetta and get it up and
running again. He grinned just at the thought of getting under the hood and
immersing his hands in the greasy&nbsp;machinery.</p>
<p>He picked up the receiver and held it to his ear.&nbsp;“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Ned&#8230;” It was Holly, and she was crying. “I called St. Ives, and they said
he isn&#8217;t there! He hasn&#8217;t come home yet! Ned, something&#8217;s wrong, I know it. I
can&#8217;t explain it, but I <em>know</em> something isn&#8217;t&nbsp;right!”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, what do you want to do?” Ned was tired, but he knew he couldn&#8217;t just
let her sit in her apartment, by herself, and worry. No, he had an obligation,
as both a friend and a man, to help her &#8211; to make sure she felt like she was
helping the situation &#8211; if there even was a&nbsp;“situation.”</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s go look for him. Maybe he&#8217;s hurt or something, you know, and if we
could&nbsp;just&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Holly, he&#8217;s probably <span class="caps">OK</span> &#8211; the chances of something happening are just&nbsp;so&#8230;”</p>
<p>“ <strong><em>Dammit</em></strong>, Ned! I <strong><em>know</em></strong> he&#8217;s not <span class="caps">OK</span>!” she screamed into the
phone, forcing Ned to move the handset away from his hear in a self-preserving&nbsp;reflex.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, <span class="caps">OK</span>, we&#8217;ll go looking for him. I&#8217;ll be there in 20&nbsp;minutes.”</p>
<p>“Thanks&nbsp;Ned.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>. I&#8217;ll see you in a few&nbsp;minutes.”</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>,&nbsp;bye.”</p>
<p>“Bye.”</p>
<p>He set the handset gently back on it&#8217;s rest, and laid his head back on the
chair, closing his eyes blissfully for a few seconds. Well, rest, relaxation,
and the Jetta would have to&nbsp;wait.</p>
<p>He stood up and called to Lavina. “I have to go out. Holly is worried about
one of the homeless guys she knows, and I&#8217;m going to go help her look for him.
I should be back in a couple of hours or&nbsp;so.”</p>
<p>Lavina met him in the hallway with yet another disapproving gaze. Out with a
beautiful young woman, no doubt. Well, <em>this</em> one wouldn&#8217;t steal her husband
away, oh no. She&#8217;d make sure of <em>that</em>.</p>
<p>Ned shook his head, knowing what she was thinking. “You needn&#8217;t worry,
darling. You&#8217;re the only woman for me.” He reached for her but she pulled
away. Oh well, someday she&#8217;d get over&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, well I will see you and the children when I get back. Children, be
good, obey your mother, and I&#8217;ll be back soon.” A chorus of acknowledgments
came from various corners of the house, and he turned, threw his jack over his
shoulders, and stepped out into the&nbsp;darkness.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 20:&nbsp;Kidnapped </strong></p>
<p>Mike&#8217;s surrounding&#8217;s slowly faded into view as he came to. He had been
unconscious twice today! It was starting to wear on his mind physically, not
to mention his&nbsp;self-confidence.</p>
<p>He soon realized that he was tied, completely unable to move, to a chair in
the center of Angelo&#8217;s office. The pieces of the broken coffee table still lay
in front of the loveseat, though the girl was now gone. He struggled against
the ropes that tied him down, but they were tight around his wrists and
ankles, and the metal chair to which he was tied seemed too tough to break. It
wouldn&#8217;t matter much, anyway. There was no way he&#8217;d make it out of the
warehouse alive. He was more likely to rob a casino and run out of the front
door unopposed than to get out of the warehouse with his skin&nbsp;intact.</p>
<p>He was, to be honest, a little surprised to find himself still alive anyway.
It was very uncharacteristic of Angelo. But Angelo did have a bit of the James
Bond villain in him, and Mike assumed that a delightfully painful death or
maiming awaited&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Angelo entered from the side door, smiling at Mike&#8217;s present consciousness.
He was closely followed by Marty, the man whose blow from behind had created a
lump on Mike&#8217;s head that still ached&nbsp;painfully.</p>
<p>“Well, Mike, it certainly is good to see you awake. It&#8217;s just not
gentlemanly to come and visit someone, then fall asleep while they&#8217;re trying
to be hospitable.” Mike ignored him as he paced around the chair to which Mike
was tied, his hands held behind his back in their customary formation, a smile
of supreme, gloating self-confidence written on his&nbsp;face.</p>
<p>“You may be wondering, Mike, why you are still alive after such an egregious
breach of my rules, of the trust that you and I have built over these past
months.” He paused, waiting for a response from Mike. There was&nbsp;none.</p>
<p>“And well you should. Ordinarily I would have killed you immediately –
wouldn&#8217;t have blinked, wouldn&#8217;t have given you a second thought.” He paused
again, ensuring Mike was&nbsp;listening.</p>
<p>“But I like you, Mike. I do. So I thought I&#8217;d give you a chance. You&#8217;ve
always been one to stick to my rules in the past, Mike, which gave me reason
to believe that something had happened to you. So, being the extremely
generous individual that I am &#8211; I <em>am</em> a humanitarian at heart, Mike, you
must believe me &#8211; I did a little sleuthing and discovered some very
interesting things about you&nbsp;Mike.”</p>
<p>Mike bristled. What the hell had Angelo dug up on him? And how had he done
it so quickly? Surely he hadn&#8217;t been out <em>that</em>&nbsp;long&#8230;</p>
<p>“Mike, I don&#8217;t know how to express to you my regret that Copeland saw fit to
fire you today.” That son of a <em>bitch</em>! “But Mike, you have to understand the
company&#8217;s position &#8211; you simply weren&#8217;t performing for them. You were a bad
horse to bet on, Mike. And you know something about betting on bad horses,
don&#8217;t you?” Angelo glanced at Mike, taking a perceptible pleasure in his
discomfort at the enraging&nbsp;comments.</p>
<p>“But it didn&#8217;t stop there, Mike, and I can honestly say that I fully
understand your actions in light of the new developments on the Turner home
front. From what I hear, Mrs. Marie Turner has told the police all about her
enraged husband who came home early and, in a fit of rage, brutally killed the
man she called her ‘one, true love.&#8217; Sad, really. You really need to learn to
control your anger, Mike. Didn&#8217;t I warn you about that last time we discussed
the races? Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter&#8230; it&#8217;s obvious you didn&#8217;t listen.” He
raised his hands above his head in mock&nbsp;consternation.</p>
<p>“Why do I even try? It&#8217;s so obvious that no one ever takes my advice to
heart!” Mike struggled violently against the ropes, causing the chair, and
himself, to fall to the floor, crushing his immobile arm uncomfortably beneath
him as he lay on his&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>Angelo knelt down, bringing his sweaty face within inches of Mike&#8217;s. His
breath reeked of acrid smoke and stale coffee; his eyes were still bloodshot
and spacey from the drugs. The toothpick he chewed in his mouth was crushed to
fine fibers from hours of nervous chewing. “The police are crawling the city
looking for you, Mike. It won&#8217;t be long before they find your wife&#8217;s <span class="caps">SUV</span>
outside&#8230; and then, I&#8217;ll have no choice but to hand you over. After all, I am
a law-abiding citizen &#8211; I don&#8217;t want to be party to a <em>murder</em>!”</p>
<p>He stood up, resuming his pacing. Mike remained on the floor, looking up at
Angelo, whose body seemed oddly out of proportion from this strange angle. “I
have a little surprise for you, Mike. A solution to <em>all</em> your problems. You
see, I have the resources necessary to keep you from the pigs&#8217; hands. I can
keep you safe. And all I ask in return is a little&#8230;” He held his index
finger and thumb slightly apart, illustrating just how little “a little” was.
“&#8230;Cooperation. Just a little cooperation. And if this goes well, I may even
be willing to forgive you that sizeable debt that you owe me. Now wouldn&#8217;t
that be&nbsp;something?”</p>
<p>Angelo&#8217;s mock-friendliness was beginning to annoy Mike, and the lack of
blood flow to his right arm was becoming extremely uncomfortable. He struggled
again against the ropes, but he had even less mobility than when he had made
his previous attempt, and his movements only confirmed the futility of his&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mike, forgive me, please! What a terrible host I am!” Angelo motioned
to Marty, who stood Mike&#8217;s chair back on it&#8217;s four legs. Mike winced as the
blood rushed back into his right arm, sending burning needles through its
entire&nbsp;length.</p>
<p>“You must forgive me, Mike. Sometimes I just get so caught up in the moment
that I forget my guests completely. It&#8217;s never intentional, I promise&nbsp;you.”</p>
<p>The phony act was really getting old. “You know what, Angelo, just cut the
bullshit and get to the&nbsp;point.”</p>
<p>Angelo frowned. He was having fun. But business was business. “Fine,” he
said. “Mike, you&#8217;re in deep shit. The cops are after you because of your
little ‘indiscretion&#8217; back at your house. So really, you don&#8217;t have much
choice. You&#8217;re going to do what I tell you, or I turn you over to the cops.
It&#8217;s that simple.&nbsp;Understand?”</p>
<p>Mike chose not to dignify the patronizing question with a response. Angelo
continued anyway. “You really should see the pictures of the man you killed,
Mike. It&#8217;s brilliant, the brutality of it, the unbridled primal passion of it
all. It&#8217;s damn near a work of art! And that&#8217;s what I need &#8211; an artist –
someone with a sense of the truly brutal, the truly primal. Someone like you,&nbsp;Mike.</p>
<p>“The organization I work with organizes a weekly ‘fight,&#8217; of sorts, and
you&#8217;re going to be the next prime attraction. You&#8217;re going to tap into that
vicious side of yourself that you love to channel so much and beat some other
guy to all hell. Or you&#8217;ll get beat to hell yourself. Either way, I&nbsp;win.”</p>
<p>He got close in to Mike&#8217;s face again. “Remember what I used to tell you,
Mike. The house <em>always</em> wins.” He smiled eerily. “Tell you what, you think
about it, and let us&nbsp;know.”</p>
<p>With that, a swift painless knock against his head brought on the blackness
once&nbsp;again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ernie was walking alone along the nearly empty street, on his way back to
St. Ives. He hadn&#8217;t lasted long when James had started telling his story.
There were too many details, too many things to remember. Ernie liked his
stories short and sweet, and happy too. That was the worst part about James&#8217;
story &#8211; it had a sad&nbsp;ending.</p>
<p>He had grown bored and restless quickly, so he and Ken had left Ned and
Holly and had continued around the area asking people about Darryl. But Ken
had grown restless too, worried that his parents would be expecting him&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>Ned and Holly were nowhere to be found, but fortunately, Ken had already
claimed his bike from the back of Ned&#8217;s van, anticipating needing to leave
before the others. 59th Street was within biking distance of Ken&#8217;s home, so
he and Ernie set off towards the nice suburban neighborhood, Ernie riding on
the rear pegs&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>The corner was empty as they passed by on Ken&#8217;s bike; the kids had all gone
in for the evening. The sun was sinking low &#8211; night was almost upon&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ken had offered to let Ernie stay in the garage again, so that Ernie
wouldn&#8217;t need to make the dangerous journey back to St. Ives, but Ernie had
grown hungry again, and he longed for some of Rho nda&#8217;s soup and the warmth of
his soft, familiar bed. So despite Ken&#8217;s protests and his own judgment, he had
set off alone back towards St.&nbsp;Ives.</p>
<p>The light had steadily decreased as he had progressed on his trip, until the
sun had dropped completely beyond the curvature of the earth, leaving nothing
but the occasionally visible stars and moon and the flickering streetlamps to
light the&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Ernie wasn&#8217;t particularly nervous. He had made the trip plenty of times
before, and even in the darkness, but the stories that he and Ken had been
hearing throughout the day of mysterious abductions caused him to be more wary
than&nbsp;normal.</p>
<p>There was nothing to give him concern, though. The street was quiet, except
for the occasional rustle of a paper cup or newspaper blowing along the
asphalt in the wind. Every so often, a car would round a corner and pass
slowly by him, but for the most part, he had the entire quiet street to&nbsp;himself.</p>
<p>And so he walked on, not paying much attention to the car that passed by
him, moving more slowly than the others, and not noticing that it was the same
car that had passed him three ties now. It came to a stop at the curb a half
block in front of Ernie, and the back door opened. A nice looking man stepped
out, dressed in a suit and tie, wearing a fedora on his head, and smiling
broadly at Ernie as he&nbsp;approached.</p>
<p>“Ernie!” he exclaimed as he approached, arms wide in greeting. “I thought it
was you! I&#8217;m glad I stopped. No music&nbsp;today?”</p>
<p>Ernie didn&#8217;t recognize the man. How did he know his name? He stiffened as
the man encompassed his body with his&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p>“I haven&#8217;t seen you in awhile! Hey, are you heading to St. Ives? How about a
ride? It&#8217;s getting kind of chilly out here&#8230; I&#8217;m sure Rho nda would prefer it
if you came in and got yourself something to eat. How about it?” He motioned
to the still open back door of the car a few meters in front of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ernie nodded. This man may know him, but Ernie didn&#8217;t recognize his face,
and Rho nda had warned him nev er to get into strange cars with people he
didn&#8217;t know. In fact, Rho nda had been clear that he shouldn&#8217;t even speak with
those he didn&#8217;t know, but he wasn&#8217;t really brea king that particular rule; the
other man was doing all the&nbsp;talking.</p>
<p>Ernie stepped around the man and continued on his way, but the man followed
him and kept talking. “Oh, come on, Ernie,” he said, wrapping one arm around
him as if they were pals. “I really have something I want to talk to you
about! I know you have a lot of problems&#8230; you know, money problems, and
problems remembering things, and stuff&#8230; I just want to help you out. Tell
you what, get in the back of the car, and I&#8217;ll feel you in on my plan&#8230; I can
solve all of your problems, I can get you out, Ernie, honest, but you need to
get in the&nbsp;car.”</p>
<p><em>If a man ever comes to you, sayin&#8217; he&#8217;s got da answer, dat he can get you
out, you just gots to do one thing, don&#8217;t listen to &#8216;im.</em> Darryl&#8217;s warning
came flooding back to him, and he felt a sudden chill of fear. He wrenched his
body away from the man&#8217;s arm and began to run down the street, but the man&#8217;s
car was already pulling up ahead of&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Two men stepped out and ran towards him. He attempted to turn and cross the
street, but they were surprisingly quick, and headed him off in the middle of
the street. They wrapped their strong arms around his body, and forced a
strange-smelling rag in his face. He struggled briefly, and felt his Walkman
slide from it&#8217;s customary position on his waistband and clatter on the floor.
The men dragged him towards the car, and pushed him roughly into the trunk as
he passed&nbsp;out.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 19:&nbsp;Story </strong></p>
<p>Holly and Ned sat down along the slope beside the drain pipe, looking
intently at the grizzled man who lounged on the pipe in front of them. He wore
a small, faded green kufi on his head, hiding his graying hair underneath it.
His face was crinkled with age, and his kind eyes glowed warmly out of the dim
surroundings. He held his hands in his lap, moving them expressively as he
spoke softly. His dark, rich voice echoed below the bridge as he told his&nbsp;tale.</p>
<p>“Well, like I was sayin&#8217;, me and Darryl was good friends. We tried to stick
together, you know, have each other&#8217;s back. ‘Course it wasn&#8217;t always that way.
Fact is, when we first met, we didn&#8217;t much care for each other at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>“You see, we first met when I tried to work his part of State Ave. one day.
I hadn&#8217;t been doing too well on my old strip, so I thought I&#8217;d move up further
north and see if I could do any&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>“The week before, I&#8217;d managed to come across some tools at a construction
site and had nabbed a squeegee there, so not only was I imposin&#8217; on Darryl&#8217;s
section of the street, I was also doing the exact gig he was. Not to mention,
I was just learnin&#8217; the trade, you know, and I hadn&#8217;t really had a chance to
hone my technique. So I wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; the best job of cleain&#8217; the windows,
‘specially compared to&nbsp;Darryl.</p>
<p>“It was all right the first few days, since we didn&#8217;t run into each other. A
couple of guys had told me that Darryl normally squeegeed that section of the
street, but to be honest, I didn&#8217;t care. I was just trying to eke by, know
what I&nbsp;mean?</p>
<p>“But eventually, Darryl and I ran into each other. He had been hearin&#8217; stuff
about another guy down on his street ruinin&#8217; his reputation and all, so when
he finally saw me, he wasn&#8217;t to pleased. But if you know Darryl, he wadn&#8217;t one
to get real angry and up in your face about somethin&#8217;. So he stopped me later
that afternoon after most people had cleared the street ad I was headin&#8217; home,
and he simply asked me to move either further north or further&nbsp;south.</p>
<p>“He explained that he&#8217;d been workin&#8217; that partickler section of the street
for some time, and that he had reputation that he&#8217;d built, and it just
wouldn&#8217;t work to have two guys tryin&#8217; to squeegee the same section. He
explained that it made more sense for us to split up ‘cause we&#8217;d be able to
have more&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>“Wal, what he said made sense, but it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to hear. And him
bein&#8217; so friendly about everything, I didn&#8217;t take him seriously. So I told him
he could shove it and I just kept on goin&#8217;, doin&#8217; what I always&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>“Next day, Darryl came up and said basically the same thing, askin&#8217; me to
move on north or south again. And again, I told him the same thing. But he was
a persistent bastard, and every day he came up to me, polite as the last time,
and explained the situation&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Eventually, it got to the point where I was considerin&#8217; movin&#8217; on just so I
wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to his lecture every day. I started tryin&#8217; to avoid
him during the day, but he usually found&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>“One day, I had had it partickly rough, and there he was, comin&#8217; on to ask
be to move on, and I just lost it. I let him have it. We got into a bit of a
scuffle, and Darryl, bein&#8217; as mild-mannered and small as he was, didn&#8217;t put up
much of a fight. Oh, don&#8217;t get me wrong, I didn&#8217;t hurt him real bad or
nothin&#8217;, but I did pound on him a&nbsp;bit.</p>
<p>“It made me feel a lot better, and I thought that he&#8217;d finally get the
picture that I wasn&#8217;t plannin&#8217; on goin&#8217; anywhere, but the next day, he found
me again and started talkin&#8217; to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>“This time, though, he&#8217;d changed his tactics. He said that if I wasn&#8217;t
movin&#8217; on, the least I could do was stop ruinin&#8217; his reputation. So he offered
to teach me how to do a better job with the squeegee. I could hardly believe
my ears. I mean, I&#8217;d just hit him up the day before &#8211; he still had a bruise on
his face from where I&#8217;d let him have&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“But as usual, it was a genuine offer, so I spent that day workin&#8217; with him,
learnin&#8217; his technique and listenin&#8217; to him ramble on about his experiences
and whatnot. Man, he liked to talk.” He paused, smiling and shaking his&nbsp;head.</p>
<p>“I mean, Darryl&#8217;d talk and talk and talk &#8211; didn&#8217;t matter if no one was
listenin&#8217;. He just liked to talk. But anyway, that night he invited me back
here, to this bridge, with him, and we spent the rest of the night talkin&#8217;
‘bout everything under the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>“And that was really all it took. We started workin&#8217; together every day, and
he taught me a lot. And he and I just became real good friends. I don&#8217;t really
know why. By all accounts, we really shoulda still hated each other. We were
very different people, but somehow we ended up makin&#8217; it&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>“Eventually he and I agreed to stop workin&#8217; together. It really made the
most sense, since we could cover twice as much area in the same amount of
time. He finally got his way, I guess &#8211; I moved on up a lit further north and
he stayed working his area, but we would get together here at the end of the
day, and share whatever we had. Sometimes he had a good day, sometimes I did,
most times neither of us did, but we shared everything and we ended up all
right I&nbsp;guess.</p>
<p>“As time went on, me and him didn&#8217;t talk as much as we had, and he started
spending more time at the shelter, I guess. I never much cared for places like
that, though he told me St. Ives was diff&#8217;rent. Anyway, when we started
hearin&#8217; all the stories ‘bout people disappearin&#8217;, we decided we&#8217;d better
start stickin&#8217; together again. It just made sense. So we started workin&#8217;
together again, and we did all&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>“But one night, Darryl decided he wanted to go to the shelter for a meal,
and when I told him I really didn&#8217;t want to go, he just left without me. I
didn&#8217;t seem him until really late the next day. I figgered he&#8217;d just ended up
stayin&#8217; the night there or somethin&#8217;, but when he came back he was all beat
up. He&#8217;d stopped by St. Ives ad I guess got cleaned up, but he looked
terrible. He was limpin&#8217;, cuts and bruises all over his body &#8211; he was a&nbsp;wreck.</p>
<p>“He wasn&#8217;t talkin&#8217; much either, and I knew better than to press him to tell
me what had happened. So we just kept on doin&#8217; what we always did for the next
few days. I figgered he&#8217;d tell me when he was ready. And finally, about a week
after it had happened, he&nbsp;did.”</p>
<p>James paused and leaned forward, lowering his voice substantially. “Now,
there were two cops snoopin&#8217; around here earlier today, askin&#8217; about him and
showin&#8217; pictures and whatnot, but I didn&#8217;t tell ‘em anything.” Holly and Ned
glanced at each other as James frowned. So Ames and Cobb <em>had</em> been&nbsp;by.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t like cops &#8211; don&#8217;t trust ‘em. Anyway, you have to understand, I&#8217;m
takin&#8217; a big risk tellin&#8217; you this, just like Darryl took a risk by tellin&#8217;
me, but people need to know. Maybe then somethin&#8217; can be&nbsp;done.”</p>
<p>He paused again, drawing Ned and Holly in closer before continuing at an
even lower volume. “Darryl told me, that as he was walkin&#8217; to St. Ives, that a
man had pulled over on the street &#8211; he couldn&#8217;t remember exactly where &#8211; and
started talkin&#8217; to him. He had said he recognized Darryl from a time when he&#8217;d
cleaned the windshield of his car, and he just wanted to compliment him on the&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>“He gave Darryl a twenty dollar bill, and then asked him if he wanted to
make a lot more. He told Darryl that it was a really simple thing he needed
done, and that if Darryl was willing there could be a lot of money in&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>“Darryl wasn&#8217;t one to believe in these get-rich-quick schemes, but he told
me that the man seemed so sincere &#8211; so honest and friendly. So Darryl accepted
the offer and had accepted a ride in the man&#8217;s car. He didn&#8217;t know where they
had gone. He said they had driven for quite&nbsp;awhile.</p>
<p>“They arrived at some warehouse or somethin&#8217;, and the man had led Darryl
into this huge empty room. Then, while Darryl waited, a whole bunch of men
started coming in and standing around the inner walls of the room. Darryl said
at least 30 to 40 men had come in, and they just stood around, not talkin&#8217; to
him or anything, just stayin&#8217; quiet with these serious expressions on their
faces, like they were anticipatin&#8217; somethin&#8217; exciting. Most of ‘em were
wearin&#8217; suits or sports jackets, Darryl had said, and they all seemed to be
businessmen or somethin&#8217; judgin&#8217; from what they were&nbsp;wearin&#8217;.</p>
<p>“Then the man who had picked Daryl up walked in and started talkin&#8217;. ‘Well
gentlemen, tonight we have a man named Darryl. He works down on State Ave. ,
where many of you work, and squeegees your windows for loose change&#8230; I think
a lot of you are familiar with him.&#8217; A lot of the men standing around let out
a whoop, and the man smiled. ‘Well, I think you all know how this works, so
who&#8217;s first tonight?&#8217; A bunch of men raised their hands, and the man pointed
to one in the back of the room. ‘<span class="caps">OK</span>, looks like you&#8217;re our lucky guy tonight.
Make us proud.&#8217; The man who&#8217;d picked Darryl up stepped out with the other men,
and the one he&#8217;d pointed out stepped into the center of the circle with
Darryl. Darryl didn&#8217;t know what was&nbsp;happenin&#8217;.</p>
<p>“The man took his shirt off and ran towards Darryl, and hit him square in
the face, knocking him to the ground. He waited for Darryl to get back up,
then hit him again. Darryl tried to get up and run away, or out of the room,
but the men in the circle would grab him and throw him back&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>“I asked ‘im if he tried to fight back, and he said he did, but there were
too many of ‘em. As soon as he got a good shot in, somebody else would step
into the circle and beat him even harder. By the end of the night, he said he
was just layin&#8217; on the floor, blood leakin&#8217; out of him, prayin&#8217; that&#8217;d all be
over soon. He passed out while they were still beatin&#8217; on&nbsp;him.”</p>
<p>Holly felt like she was going to be sick. She had experienced her share of
violence, but this beating that James spoke of sounded almost sports-like. Who
were all these men? Did they really get off on beating a defenseless homeless
man nearly to&nbsp;death?</p>
<p>James noticed his audience&#8217;s discomfort and broke off his more detailed
description that Darryl had given him. His voice was still low and he looked
around nervously, searching for anyone that might be listening in
surreptitiously. Satisfied that all was clear, he&nbsp;continued.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Darryl came to after the man who&#8217;d picked him up splashed some
water on his face. They threw him back into the car and drove him back to the
street where they&#8217;d picked him up. Before they dropped him off, the man said,
‘Darryl, I hope you understand that if you tell anyone about this, and I mean
anyone,&#8217; &#8211; he was very clear on this point &#8211; ‘I&#8217;m gonna hunt you down and kill
not only <em>you</em>, but <em>every single person that you told</em>.&#8217; Darryl believed
him. He said there was somethin&#8217; in his eyes that told him he was&nbsp;serious.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Darryl wouldn&#8217;t tell nobody &#8211; and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been careful
m&#8217;self. But there comes a time when this kinda things got to be exposed, and
maybe y&#8217;all can do&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>James sat back on the pipe and sighed heavily. He was pleased to finally
tell someone Darryl&#8217;s story, but worried too &#8211; now these fine people, friends
of Darryl&#8217;s, also had the burden of Darryl&#8217;s experience? There was little
doubt in James&#8217; mind that the man responsible for Darryl&#8217;s abduction and
beating was also responsible for his death. Would he also now harm these
people, and James&nbsp;himself?</p>
<p>Holly and Ned looked at each other. They also understood the magnitude of
the situation. It seemed their quest for answers had yielded some, but also
created more&nbsp;questions.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 18:&nbsp;Memory </strong></p>
<p>“Joel?” He opened his eyes slowly, allowing them to adjust to the bright
light that now shone into his room. His mother&#8217;s concerned eyes stared down at
him, his father smiled grimly from the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s good to see you awake, son,” his father said, walking over and placing
a hand on his shoulder as his mother buried her teary face in his&nbsp;chest.</p>
<p>“Mom, I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span>&#8230;” he protested. Why did she always have to worry so&nbsp;much?</p>
<p>“I know, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m crying.” He rolled his eyes. His mother slowly tore
herself away from him, content eventually to hold his&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>“When we didn&#8217;t hear from you, we started to worry,” his dad began. “But we
figured you were tired and forgot to call or something. Then the police
called, and we tried to get down here as fast as we could, but you were in
surgery, and even after that the police wouldn&#8217;t let us get in here until
they&#8217;d had a chance to talk to you. What did they want to know,&nbsp;anyway?”</p>
<p>“Just what happened, that&#8217;s all,” Joel answered, staring up at the white&nbsp;ceiling.</p>
<p>“Well, we&#8217;re just glad that you&#8217;re all right,” his mom&nbsp;interjected.</p>
<p>“I am, mom, I am.” He patted her hand in&nbsp;reassurance.</p>
<p>“Well, how was the return trip? We read all your letters. Sounds like you
had a great&nbsp;time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the trip back was pretty uneventful. It was sort of sad, really. I
mean, I was excited to be coming back here, you know, but I sort of felt like
I was leaving home, too. It was very&nbsp;strange.”</p>
<p>“Well, son you were there for almost 6 months. I suppose that place is a
part of you&nbsp;now.”</p>
<p>Joel smiled at his father&#8217;s phrasing. It was a little melodramatic, to be
sure, but he did like the sound of it, and in truth, it wasn&#8217;t that far off
the mark. The culture he&#8217;d experienced there, the people, the way the people
there had approached life &#8211; it was all a part of him. It was something that
he&#8217;d nev er forget, something that would shape all of his decisions and
thoughts from now&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess if you&#8217;ve read my letters, then there&#8217;s not a whole lot left
to&nbsp;tell&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Oh, nonsense! We have plenty of questions! Do you feel up to&nbsp;talking?”</p>
<p>Joel smiled. If there was one thing he felt like doing, it was talking. It
was nice to revel in their interest for awhile, to explain the experiences
which had changed him so much, and the pain was bearable now, so he should
make the best of the&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<p>His father pulled up a chair and sat, and Joel told them about his trip from
start to finish, making embellishments here and there for dramatic effect.
They were a captive audience &#8211; neither of them had nev er traveled outside the
state, let alone the country &#8211; and Joel did his best to explain the paramount
differences in culture and world-view that he had experienced on his trip, and
what he had felt he&nbsp;learned.</p>
<p>None of the trio noticed when Ames and Cobb entered the&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>“So Sean pauses, for effect, you know, then says, ‘A date with Natalie Port
man.&#8217; That&#8217;s all he wanted!” His parents broke out in appreciative chuckles.
“So after we all got done&nbsp;laughing&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Excuse me Mr. Mendocino,” Ames broke in, clearing his throat to get their
attention. Joel looked up at him. What did they&nbsp;want?</p>
<p>“Hi detective. What can I do for&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>The two detectives strode in, dragging chairs from the small table in the
corner and sat down around his bed. They had been traveling around for most of
the day, talking to every homeless man they could find in an effort to figure
out who was responsible for Darryl&#8217;s&nbsp;murder.</p>
<p>What they had been told baffled them. The homeless men had told them all the
same story &#8211; some mysterious disappearances had occurred, people would wind up
beaten up, but wouldn&#8217;t say anything more about it. No one they&#8217;d spoken to
knew Darryl personally, so they said, but both Ames and Cobb had gotten the
feeling that some of them were holding back, especially a grizzled man down on
59 th&nbsp;.</p>
<p>They had checked some records back at the station and at local hospitals,
and had found several unsolved crimes the past few mont hs, all involving
homeless people. Nearly 100% of the cases they had found involved&nbsp;men.</p>
<p>None of the homeless had pressed charges, of course, and were tight-lipped
about what had happened, so the cases were closed and no one took a second
look. But Ames and Cobb agreed &#8211; there was a pattern&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>It was still a long shot to tie Darryl into the whole scheme. By most
accounts, he had been abducted, but none of the other abductees had been
killed, and it was still a distinct possibility that his death was just
random. But in the end, Cobb and Ames agreed that their instincts needed to be
trusted, especially this early in the investigation, and their instincts said
that there was something behind all of this &#8211; something sinister, something
that needed to be stopped, and behind it all, there was a case that could make
their&nbsp;careers.</p>
<p>Bereft of clues, they decided to go back to the source, to the only witness
to the crime, even though he hadn&#8217;t been able to tell them anything useful on
their first visit. Perhaps he&#8217;d remember more&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Mendocino, we&#8217;re hoping you can give us some more information.
You see, we&#8217;ve been around talking to a lot of homeless people today, and
they&#8217;ve given us some leads, but we really need a description of your&nbsp;assailants.</p>
<p>“Admittedly, this is a long shot, but we think the men who killed Darryl –
that was the name of the homeless man we found with you &#8211; and shot you are
possibly connected to a lot other violent crime, especially among the
homeless. Obviously, if these guys have escalated to m ur der and have a
history of violence, we&#8217;re probably going to see a lot more needless deaths if
we don&#8217;t find them&nbsp;soon.”</p>
<p>Joel protested, “Well, I already told you what I know&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure what
else you want me to try and remember. I didn&#8217;t really get a good look at
them&#8230;” This wasn&#8217;t entirely true. In fact, Joel had gotten a solid look at
their faces, but he hadn&#8217;t been paying attention. After all, they were
pointing a gun at him. He wasn&#8217;t making mental notes about their shoe size or
the number of freckles on their faces at that&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>His mother joined in the protest. “Detectives, my son just got shot! Can&#8217;t
you give him a little time to recover before you come in here barraging him
with questions and&nbsp;making&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Monica,” Joel&#8217;s father interrupted. “They&#8217;re just trying to find the men
that did this. Joel can say no if he wants to. It&#8217;s his&nbsp;decision.”</p>
<p>Ames continued. “Well, what we&#8217;d like to do, Joel, if I may call you that,
is just have you relax and concentrate on the experience as you think back on
it. We&#8217;ve found that many times, if you just relax and focus on a single
element of your memory, you can recall things that you forgot or didn&#8217;t even
fully realize&nbsp;before.”</p>
<p>Joel nodded. He wasn&#8217;t terrible keen on trying to think back on the
experience of getting shot, but if it would help the detectives find the men
and possibly save someone else, then it would be worth his&nbsp;discomfort.</p>
<p>Ames motioned outside Joel&#8217;s door, where a young woman stood with a large
sketch pad and an assortment of pencils in her&nbsp;arms.</p>
<p>“Joel, this is Karen, one of the artists on our staff down at the station.
She&#8217;s just going to try and draw some sketches based on the descriptions that
you can give us. Don&#8217;t worry about her. Just close your eyes and ell us what
you can. We&#8217;ll do the&nbsp;rest.”</p>
<p>Joel laid back against the pillow and shut his eyes as Karen moved yet
another chair into the cramped suite and sat down, pencil at the&nbsp;ready.</p>
<p>He thought back to the delicious taste of the bagel on his tongue, the feel
of the concrete and loose gravel as it crunched under his feet, and the
feeling of sudden isolation he felt upon discovering he was&nbsp;lost.</p>
<p>He was standing in the empty alien alley again, turning round and round,
looking for signs of familiarity, but he found&nbsp;none.</p>
<p>“I was in this alley that I&#8217;d nev er been in before &#8211; I didn&#8217;t know where I&nbsp;was.”</p>
<p>Bang! There it was &#8211; the shot! But was it a shot, or just a firecracker, or
a car&nbsp;misfiring?</p>
<p>“I heard a loud shot, but I didn&#8217;t know what it&nbsp;was.”</p>
<p>Then he was running, running, running towards the shot. Why was he running
towards it? Why not away? His actions made no sense. He tried to force his
body to turn, to stop, to at least slow, but he ran&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>There were voices now&#8230; what had they&nbsp;said?</p>
<p>“I heard them talking before I got there. One of them was yelling at the
other for pulling the trigger and shooting the man, and he was saying he
didn&#8217;t do it on&nbsp;purpose.”</p>
<p>He rounded the corner &#8211; there they were, looking down at the dumpster, where
the shot man was lying, his body obscured from Joel&#8217;s view by the&nbsp;dumpster.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, I see them now. They&#8217;re looking down at the man, but they don&#8217;t see me
yet. The man with the gun is average height and build, dark brown hair,
leather jacket, stubble on his face. The other man is a little shorter, say 5&#8217;
5” or so, with blonde hair, clean shaven, and a light black windbreaker. Both
of them are wearing&nbsp;jeans.”</p>
<p>Ames glanced at Karen, then at Cobb. This description was so generic it&#8217;d be
impossible to get Karen to create a useful drawing from it. Yet another dead&nbsp;end&#8230;</p>
<p>They turned and spotted him. He felt a strange, uncontrollable sense of
fear. The gun was pointed directly at him. The man was saying&nbsp;something&#8230;</p>
<p>“Joel,” Cobb broke in. “Can you see any distinguishing features on either of
the men? Something bout the way they walk, or a scar, or&nbsp;something?”</p>
<p>“No, no, don&#8217;t shoot&#8230;” A sweat broke out on his brow and he shook his head
from side to side on the pillow, eyes still clenched&nbsp;shut.</p>
<p>“ Cal m down Joel, it&#8217;s all right,” Cobb continued. “Concentrate &#8211; is there
anything that stands out in your&nbsp;mind?”</p>
<p>Joel let out a gasp, then a low moan, then went limp on the bed. He was
lying on the sidewalk, reeling in agony; his insides felt as though they&#8217;d
been ripped apart. He looked up at the men as they t ur ned away, vaguely
aware of Cobb&#8217;s voice trickling down from the&nbsp;heavens.</p>
<p>Then, a sudden point of clarity &#8211; there, on the shooter&#8217;s hand, a mark. As
they turned and ran, Joel willed himself to focus on that mark. Time slowed
down; he stepped frame by frame through the scene, and zoomed in on the mark,
bringing it into better focus. Then, suddenly, it was gone, and he was falling
endlessly&nbsp;again.</p>
<hr />
<p>He awoke a few minutes later, amidst confused chatter and argument from his
parents, the detectives, and Heather, who had come in after hearing the&nbsp;commotion.</p>
<p>“Give me the paper,” Joel said. No response. “Give me the paper!” he said
again, finally getting the attention of the others in the room. There was a
moment of stunned silence, then Karen thrust her pad and pencil at him. She
held the pad for him while he awkwardly sketched the mark he had seen on the
page as best he&nbsp;could.</p>
<p>He finished it, and handed the pencil back to Karen. “That mark was tattooed
on the right hand of the shooter, between the thumb and forefinger. Now <em>that
</em> is all I can remember.” He sunk back into the bed &#8211; he wanted peace, quiet,
and&nbsp;sleep.</p>
<p>Cobb and Ames looked at the picture, than at each other. Now <em>this</em> was
something they could work&nbsp;with.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 17:&nbsp;Journey</strong></p>
<p>Ernie was stuffed. He and Ken pushed away from the table, entirely satisfied
with the hearty meal that Rhonda and the other St. Ives volunteers had
provided them. The dining hall, which had been silent during the meal as
groups of hungry homeless dug in to their meals, was now home to a healthy din
of activity, as well-fed men and women chatted, discussed, and&nbsp;joked.</p>
<p>Rhonda and her staff bustled around the hall, stopping occasionally to say
hello to someone they hadn&#8217;t seen in a long time, or to welcome someone new
and make sure they felt welcome to come and dine at St. Ives any&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Rhonda was particularly busy. The unseasonably warm weather
had brought visitors from all over. When the weather was warm, people tended
to get out and walk further, so the dining hall was bursting at the seams with
hungry mouths. She ran back and forth from the kitchen, stopping every once in
awhile to greet some of the visitors personally and introduce herself
personally. She wore a big friendly smile on her face, and despite her
business, always gave each individual her full attention while she talked with&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Ernie and Ken were seated a smaller table in the corner of the room right
next to the kitchen door, where they observed the other diners with passive
interest. Ernie didn&#8217;t recognize many of the people there today. They were
probably from the west side, and were only able to make it to St. Ives today
because of the&nbsp;weather.</p>
<p>He had overheard a couple of conversations, while he and Ken ate their soup
quietly, about Darryl. It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to hear familiar names, especially
after someone got arrested, hurt, or killed, particularly amongst residents or
frequent visitors to St.&nbsp;Ives.</p>
<p>He hadn&#8217;t gotten any more information about exactly what had happened to
Darryl, but there had been quite a bit of talk about the mysterious
disappearances of people the past few weeks, and their reappearance with fresh
cuts and bruises. The general consensus among those Ernie overheard was that
Darryl had gotten “abducted” as well, except this time, he&#8217;d wound up&nbsp;dead.</p>
<p>Ernie and Ken relaxed at their table once the meal was complete, waiting for
the dining room to clear out somewhat. It was just as well; their bellies were
so overstuffed with Rhonda&#8217;s hearty soup that they could barely&nbsp;move.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for the crowd to leave the dining hall after lunch was
complete. It was a warm day, after all; a day that would best be spent working
their corner or block, making the most of the warmth. It was __ a day to
be spent inside, warming oneself in the heated interior of the&nbsp;shelter.</p>
<p>Ken, who&#8217;d been keeping a watchful eye on the clock that peered down across
the dining hall, motioned to Ernie that they should get going. They had a few
minutes to walk back to Dominick&#8217;s and meet Holly there. Neither Ken nor Ernie
really knew what to expect from their journey to 59 th Street , but Holly
seemed to think that someone there would know something, and it made sense to
follow her lead. Ernie&#8217;s presence with them would increase their credibility
anyhow, and they&#8217;d be more likely to get the information they were&nbsp;seeking.</p>
<p>Ken&#8217;s zeal for the investigative arts had cooled somewhat. He had come to
the conclusion, after they were unable to gain access to the hospital, that
the life of a true investigator was nothing like that in his books, and that
he&#8217;d be better off finding another occupation. He had, however, dragged Ernie
along on this whole escapade, and felt somewhat responsible to see it through
to its conclusion. Besides, if they did by some miracle manage to find out
what happened to Darryl&#8230; well, <em>that</em> would be cool. His friends on the
corner would <em>definitely</em> give him mad props for&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>They stood up from the table and waved at Rhonda in the kitchen, then headed
out of St. Ives towards&nbsp;Dominick&#8217;s.</p>
<hr />
<p>The hours between Ernie and Ken&#8217;s initial visit and three seemed to stretch
on forever as Holly and Ned rang up customer after customer. Ned was moving a
little more slowly than usual; his mind was on other things. He worried about
Holly. She had put on a brave face when they had come back into the store, but
inside he knew she wasn&#8217;t doing so well. He had seen her talking at length
with Darryl after work in the parking lot; they had talked about life, love,
the pursuit of happiness, and everything else under the&nbsp;sun.</p>
<p>It continued to amaze him how easily Holly spoke to everyone, especially the
homeless. Her natural listening ear combined with Darryl&#8217;s love to speak had
naturally drawn them to each other. Ned had not been privy to many of their
conversations, but he knew that to Holly, Darryl was a special friend &#8211; she
would miss&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch for what seemed like the millionth time. Only a few
minutes had passed, but three o&#8217;clock was almost upon them. He flipped the
light on his register, signaling that he was now&nbsp;closed.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry,” he said to the confused customers still in his line. “I&#8217;ll
finish up with whoever&#8217;s in my line right now, I&#8217;m just not going to be taking
any new customers.” He smiled reassuringly back at them, and finished checking
out the final customer in record&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Holly was already headed back towards he back of the store to punch out, so
he quickly double-checked his register and followed her blonde head back to
the time-card&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>They remained silent as they walked together to the front of the store and
pushed through the revolving door into the glaring mid-afternoon sun. Ernie
and Ken were just walking into the parking lot, and the four of them
rendezvoused in the middle of the nearly deserted&nbsp;lot.</p>
<p>Ernie still wasn&#8217;t his usual active self, Holly noticed, but the lunch had
done him good; at least he didn&#8217;t look so peaked &#8211; just sad. His headphone&#8217;s
still hung around his neck uselessly, which was unusual and ind icated that
perhaps he had been taking this harder than she had initially thought. Well,
hopefully the guys at 59 th street would be able to shed some light on the
whole situation and give them all a little bit of&nbsp;closure.</p>
<p>Ned was glad that he&#8217;d driven the van today. Normal ly he drove an old,
barely running Volkswagen Jetta, but it had not been cooperating this morning,
so Lavina had offered to take the bus to her job across town, so Ned could
take the van. The van would easily accommodate all four of the travelers; the
Jetta would have been quit a&nbsp;squeeze.</p>
<p>Everyone piled in, Ned driving, Holly in the passenger seat, and Ken and
Ernie in the back, staring silently out the window as they pulled out of the
parking lot. The trip to 59 th was not far, and traffic was light at this
point in the afternoon, so they arrived at the underpass within a few&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>Ned pulled over to the right and turned on his emergency fla shers. There
was nowhere to park in this area, but he hoped they wouldn&#8217;t be staying long;
though Holly knew several of the people here, and Ernie was no doubt a
familiar face to most, he still felt uncomfortable. He didn&#8217;t readily admit
it, especially to Holly, but the grubby faces with their piercing eyes and
wary stares, the dirty, worn corduroys, jeans, and jackets, and the makeshift
dwellings made of cardboard and newspaper &#8211; all of it made him very&nbsp;uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He stuck close to Holly as she moved confidently through the individual
dwellings under the bridge, Ernie and Ken trailing a short distance behind.
She stopped several times to speak with people she recognized, but moved on
after determining that the person knew nothing about&nbsp;Darryl.</p>
<p>They milled about for around 20 minutes, Holly growing more and more
impatient as they walked. No one knew anything &#8211; or if they did, they weren&#8217;t
telling her. As they passed by the dark recesses of a drain pipe along the
lower end of the slope, a low, rich voice called out&nbsp;softly.</p>
<p>“Hey.” Holly turned, peering in the direction from which the voice had come.
She saw nothing. “Down here, in the pipe.” Looking down she saw the
silhouetted outline of a man lying inside the large pipe, a thin blanket
wrapped around&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>“As long as the water ain&#8217;t runnin&#8217;, there&#8217;s not a better bed for miles,” he
said, referring to the pipe in which he laid. “I hear you guys are lookin&#8217; for&nbsp;Darryl.”</p>
<p>Holly stepped closer to the man, who pulled himself out of the pipe and
stood to greet&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>“Well, not exactly&#8230; Darryl&#8217;s dead&#8230;” Holly said softly, looking down at
her feet as she&nbsp;spoke.</p>
<p>“Oh, I know,” the man responded. “My name&#8217;s James. We&#8217;se quite a pair, me
and him. Used to share everything we made, everything we had. We were good
friends. So if there&#8217;s somethin&#8217; you want to know about him, I&#8217;m your man.” He
thrust his hand out at Holly, who took it and shook it firmly. Ned followed&nbsp;suit.</p>
<p>“Well, it ain&#8217;t much,” James said, motioning at the concrete slope alongside
the drain pipe. “But have a seat&#8230; let&#8217;s talk about&nbsp;Darryl.”</p>
