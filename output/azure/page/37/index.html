                                    <p><a href="http://www.1up.com">1Up.com</a> is running a story called <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116290">The Essential 50</a>, which lists what
they consider to be the 50 most essential video games. It&#8217;s an interesting
history lesson, since every entry has a short history of the game, the
innovations it had, and the impact it had on the industry and video game
development. Interestingly, several games&#8217; major impact was not technology or
innovation, as I would have imagined, but rather political and/or social.
Interesting&nbsp;stuff.</p>

                                    <p>When I received an email with the subject &#8220;American Airlines Apologizes For
Your Flight Delay,&#8221; I got a little excited. &#8220;Yes! They&#8217;ll probably offer me a
free flight or some frequent flyer miles or something! Then my hours of
meaningless waiting at the Seattle-Tacoma terminal won&#8217;t be for nought!&#8221; Alas,
it was not to be. Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Tyler&nbsp;Butler,</p>
<p>On two separate occasions during the past week, we experienced technical
difficulties with our computer systems, causing some flights to be delayed. We
understand that you traveled during both periods and likely were doubly&nbsp;inconvenienced.</p>
<p>Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience you may have
experienced, and rest assured that we are working diligently to take
corrective actions. We greatly value your business, appreciate your
understanding and look forward to delivering the service you deserve in the
near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan Garton<br />
Executive Vice President Marketing<br />
American&nbsp;Airlines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose I was dumb to assume that there would be some sort of incentive for
me to continue my association with their airline included in the email, but
there wasn&#8217;t. As I thought about it more, I realized that flight delays are
just something you have to deal with when you fly, and the fact that I was
expecting to get something out of my suffering was a by-product of a
suffocating atmosphere of &#8220;customer-is-always-right&#8221; consumerism. So, though I
initially wanted to call them and give them a chance to offer me something, I
decided to keep my mouth&nbsp;shut.</p>
<p>Maybe I did get something after&nbsp;all?</p>

                                    <p>I came across several different articles regarding a wide variety of topics,
but they all center around Apple&#8217;s <span class="caps">OS</span>, user interface design, and the concept
of cruft. I found them to be quite interesting, and I learned a lot. I think
I&#8217;m going to force the <span class="caps">IPRO</span> 305 students to read a few of them before they
start redesigning the <a href="http://www.hawktour.net">HawkTour</a>&nbsp;interface.</p>

<p>A good introduction to the basic concept of cruft, which, as the article
states, should be familiar to any programmer worth his salt, especially those
involved in <span class="caps">UI</span> design. Unfortunately, few programmers, let alone computer
users, realize what sort of cruft they&#8217;ve become accustomed to through regular

                                    <p>eBay used to be safe, and for the most part, I suppose it still is. The honest
people in the world still outnumber the dishonest ones, and I hope it stays
that way forever. But anyone who has used eBay a fair amount has gotten
scammed at least once or twice, or at the very least, received emails from
people fishing for a gullible seller/buyer to scam. I myself paid for a
relatively expensive item that was never sent to me. Luckily, in that case, I
was protected because I went through eBay and they refunded my money. Of
course, I was out a few hundred bucks for about three months while I went
through their fraud process. That pretty much sucks for someone on a
shoestring budget like me (though one has to wonder just how shoestring my
budget is if I can spend hundreds of dollars on eBay&#8230; yup, I&#8217;m enigmatic
like&nbsp;that&#8230;).</p>
<p>Anyway, I saw a story on Slashdot about an eBay scammer, and eventually found
this site, <a href="http://www.p-p-p-powerbook.com/">P-P-P-Powerbook.com</a>, that chronicles a relatively recent
(April/May 2004) scam story. It&#8217;s really really funny, and there are some
awesome pictures to go with it. I have the <span class="caps">PDF</span> document shared on here, but
I&#8217;d really recommend checking the site as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough to explain quickly what exactly happened. I guess the really
important thing is that the seller, who was trying to sell an Apple Powerbook,
was contacted by a scammer who wanted to buy the Powerbook through an Escrow
site. Eventually the seller decided to scam this scammer, and eventually sent
him a P-P-P-Powerbook, picturres of which are below. Anyway, the story is
quite long and involved, but very humorous, so I&#8217;d recommend checking it out.
Some of my favorite picutres are below (there are more in the <span class="caps">PDF</span> and at the
site). Oh, and there&#8217;s also a hilarious site that offers <a href="http://bu.dotsomething.net/powerbook/ppppstore.html">P-P-P-Powerbooks for
sale</a>. It looks pretty&nbsp;legitimate&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>I am a mobile guy. I use my laptop on the road a lot, and at home I have three
different computers (desktop, server, media box). On top of all that I use
<a href="http://omega.cs.iit.edu/">Omega</a> to host some files and such for easy mobile access. I have
everything networked together using windows file sharing, and for most part,
everything wors flawlessly. The problem is, I often need to copy or move files
from one remote location to another. Simple, right? Just drag and drop!
Unfortunately, often times the windows I need to drag to aren&#8217;t readily
visible, and it is relatively time consuming to drag down to the taskbar, wait
for the window to become active, then drag back up to the window to drop the&nbsp;file.</p>
<p>If Windows would let me drop items on the taskbar, it&#8217;d be all good, but since
it won&#8217;t, I decided to make my own application that would allow me faster
access to common &#8220;drop&#8221;&nbsp;locations.</p>
<p>I did this in C# using a copy of Visual Studio .<span class="caps">NET</span> that I got through
Illinois Tech&#8217;s Academic Alliance program through Microsoft. I&#8217;d never used C#
or .<span class="caps">NET</span> before, so I learned as I&nbsp;went.</p>
<p>DropBoxxer sits in your system tray, and doesn&#8217;t take up any screen real
estate at all until needed. When you select a file and drag it over the left
corner (right above the system time) DropBoxxer fade up and in from off
screen. There are different &#8220;drop boxes&#8221; for various locations, with three
types of icons &#8211; one for local locations, one for remote locations, and one
for the Recycle Bin (note that the recycle bin icon doesn&#8217;t currently work in
version 0.1). Simply drop the file over one of these drop boxes, and the
program copies or moves the file to the drop location. By default, everything
is copied rather than moved, but simply hold down the Shift key as your drag
the file(s) onto the drop box, and the files will be moved rather than copied.
As you drag something over a drop box, the location bar will display where the
current drop box points, in case you forget or need to double&nbsp;check.</p>
<p>After the job is complete, DropBoxxer fades back down off screen so you
don&#8217;t have to worry about it any more. Next time you need it, simply drag a
file back over and it&#8217;ll automatically reappear. To exit the program, simply
right-click on its task bar icon and select &#8220;Exit&nbsp;DropBoxxer.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong><em>Notes About Version&nbsp;0.1</em></strong></p>
<p>Everything is currently hardcoded, so it&#8217;s not a whole lot of use to anyone
other than me unless you want to get into the source code (included in the
download) to make modifications. I plan to add functionality that will allow
you to drag folders onto the drop area to add drop locations, or at the very
least provide a menu option to that effect when you right click in the system
tray. I&#8217;d also like to provide some better progress indicators when copying
large files. As it stands right now, you don&#8217;t have any indication of what&#8217;s
going on or how long the process is going to&nbsp;take.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to trim the file size down a bit. It&#8217;s almost an entire meg
executable, which seems ridiculously large for something as simple as it is.
Probably has something to do with the image files I store in&nbsp;there&#8230;</p>
<p>You can snag a copy of DropBoxxer Version 0.1 here. The zip contains an
executable and the source code files/resources. The source code is crappy
right now, but I will clean it up when I add the other functionality. If you
make modifications to the code, please write me and let me know. DropBoxxer
requires Windows <span class="caps">XP</span> (because of the fading and transparency effects), and
requires the .<span class="caps">NET</span> framework (I know, I know, but seriously, there is no other
way to do an application that operates in a snazzy way and integrates so
closely with Windows. Java? I think&nbsp;not&#8230;)</p>
