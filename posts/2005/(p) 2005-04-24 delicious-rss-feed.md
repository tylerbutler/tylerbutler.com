I removed the [Del.icio.us][1] RSS feed from the right side of the site
because it was getting too long. If I had [as many][2] as [Patrick][3], the
front page would render about a mile long. So I'm looking for a way to limit
the number of entries in the feed to something more manageable, like 10. I
really only want to share the most recent entries through a feed anyway --
that's what a feed is for! If I want to share _everything_ I'll point people
to the site! So if anyone knows how to cut down the number of entries in the
feed, let me know.
