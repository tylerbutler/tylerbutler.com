I saw this article linked over at Slashdot today and found it to be a very
interesting read. I've had many debates with people that think that byte-
compiled languages like Java and C# just have inherent performance problems.
Often they'll spout off some nonsense about how garbage collection is
inefficient or something. Sure, _sometimes_ it's better to have manual control
over your memory allocation/deallocation, but this article makes a
surprisingly good case for why the perceived performance hits in dynamic
management don't even exist. A great read, especially if you don't know much
about how memory management works in the first place.
