If you like adventure games, or just a great story, you owe it to yourself to pick up Telltale Games' *The Wolf Among Us*. If you're an Xbox user, it's free right now! Be warned, however, that the game is episodic so you'll almost certainly end up paying for the other episodes. Definitely worth every penny though. If you're on the fence [Polygon has a good review][3] or you can always [try out the demo][4] on Xbox 360.

You can also get *The Wolf Among Us* for Windows and Mac on [Steam][1] (where the season pass happens to be on sale currently) and [iOS][2].
