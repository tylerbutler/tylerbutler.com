  <section>
    <h1>Colophon</h1>

    <p>
      This site is built using <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a>,
      a modern static site generator. It was previously built with
      <a href="/projects/engineer">Engineer</a>, a static site generator I wrote myself
      after being inspired by Jekyll, Hyde, and other similar projects.
    </p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>
      The design was created by me using CSS Grid and Flexbox. The site uses a
      clean, typography-focused layout with a background image by Klaus Bürgle.
    </p>

    <h2>Typography</h2>
    <p>
      The site uses several fonts from Adobe Fonts (Typekit):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Westgate</strong> - Main site title</li>
      <li><strong>Adelle</strong> - Body text and headings</li>
      <li><strong>Lato</strong> - Navigation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Hosting</h2>
    <p>
      The site is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>
      with automatic deployments from GitHub. The domain is registered through Hover.
    </p>

    <h2>Source Code</h2>
    <p>
      The complete source code for this website is available on
      <a href="https://github.com/tylerbutler/tylerbutler.com-hugo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

      through these links, I may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.
