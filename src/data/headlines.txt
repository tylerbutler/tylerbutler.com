A big man with small dogs
Always shoot for the moon, but be happy with a star
Few people will volunteer to help you with problems they don't know about
Never deprive someone of the opportunity to give
Following the rules is important, but only for those that don't know any better
Talk is cheap. Execution matters.
Trust first, ability second
The dose makes the poison
Be kind to me, or treat me mean; I'll make the most of it; I'm an extraordinary machine
If it can mean anything, it doesn't mean anything
The person saying something can't be done shouldn't interrupt the person doing it
At the end of the game, the King and Pawn go back in the same box
Boring gets a "B" at best
Stay busy. Be useful.
You either die too young, or die too old. Who can say which is better?
Untested code doesn't work
Keep your eye on the donut, not the hole
It's incredible what you can accomplish when you don't care who gets the credit
Remember: all men would be tyrants if they could
Be wary of those who rarely change their minds
How do I get to Carnegie hall? Practice, man, practice.
Argue like you're right, listen like you're wrong
