                                    <p>I have been looking for a new apartment for what seems like forever. I started
out with 5 other roommates, but when they decided to go into a house that just
wasn&#8217;t up to my standards, I struck out on my own and started looking for one-
bedroom places. Unfortunately, the search was tough. Many places I looked at
were either in fairly bad shape or just too expensive for the size. I was
getting pretty discouraged, especially since my financial situation isn&#8217;t
exactly great and time was running&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>On Saturday of last week (August 7) I looked at a 2 1/2 room studio apartment
on Hamilton Avenue, close to the corner of 35th and Archer. I liked what I saw
- and I liked the price, too. It was a little further from campus than I had
hoped (about a 15-minute drive, depending on the lights), but it had beautiful
hardwood floors, a large walk-in closet, and was in pretty good shape. It also
smelled great, which, considering some of the other places I looked at, was a
definite plus. The landlord was understanding of my financial situation, and I
explained to him that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay until later the following week
because <a href="/2004/08/i-hate-banks/">my bank is stupid</a>. That was fine with him, so I crossed my
fingers and waited until Friday so my bank would finally ackowledge that I had
the necessary funds in my account (have I mentioned yet that <a href="/2004/08/i-hate-banks/">I despise
banks?</a>).</p>
<p>Thankfully (and miraculously), my bank cleared the funds just before I needed
to make the withdrawal for the security deposit and first month&#8217;s rent. I
headed over to the landlord&#8217;s office, got everything in order, and had the
keys in my hand in less than an hour. It felt really good to have the keys in
my hand. I grabbed Alex&#8217;s camera and headed over to get some pictures before I
destroyed the place with my stuff. Some of the best ones are here. Others are
available in the download section. Click on the photos below to get an
even bigger&nbsp;photo.</p>

                                    <p>I hate banks. I despise them. I wish a plague of death and disease upon them.
The concept of a bank seems simple, and indeed, useful, at least at first.
People have money that they want to secure somehow so their money doesn&#8217;t get
stolen from under their mattress or out of their wallets. So they give their
money to an <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/">insured</a> &#8220;corporation&#8221; of sorts that holds their money and
keeps a record of how much they have. For large transactions, the account
holder can write a check for the amount of money they want to transfer to
another party and sign it. The &#8220;corporation,&#8221; (aka the bank) honors the
request to transfer and handles the details so that the account holder doesn&#8217;t
have to. This is simple, right? This is &#8220;protecting ourselves,&#8221;&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. In my experience, banks are nothing but hassle, especially
for people like me that have very limited funds available and need to bleed
our accounts dry about every week or so. <a href="http://www.iit.edu">Illinois Tech</a> pays me every two
weeks with a check that I deposit to my checking account at <a href="http://www.lakesidebank.com">Lakeside
Bank</a>. These checks are <strong>not</strong> out of state (obviously); In fact, they&#8217;re
drawn from Lakeside Bank! <em>So why does it take a <strong>week</strong> for my deposit to
show up in my&nbsp;account?</em></p>
<p>This was the question I set out to answer a couple of weeks ago. The problem
arose when I made an electronic bill payment after making a deposit that my
online account information reported had been deposited and was available. The
bank charged me an overdraft fee, claiming that the deposited funds were on
hold, even though the account screen online clearly said that the funds were
available. I called the bank and was given the basic&nbsp;run-around:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This person is who you need to talk&nbsp;to.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Phone transfer. Wait for a&nbsp;while.</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>No, it&#8217;s so and&nbsp;so.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Another transfer. Doesn&#8217;t go through. Back to&nbsp;operator.</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m sorry, she&#8217;s out of town for&#8230; ummm&#8230; looks like&nbsp;forever.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Is there anyone else I can speak&nbsp;with?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ummmm, no. You&#8217;re&nbsp;screwed.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Can you help me at&nbsp;all?</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>No. That&#8217;s not my job. I just transfer phone calls. I am here to make your
life&nbsp;miserable.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Well, tell your supervisor I said you&#8217;re doing an excellent&nbsp;job.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ummm,&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that entirely useless exchange, I headed over to see if I could have
better luck in person. I did, sort of. I got thrown around a bit from person
to person, but finally one of the bankers helped me. She explained that these
checks were not being deposited in my account immediately because I was a &#8220;new
customer.&#8221; New customer?! I&#8217;ve been banking there for <strong>four years!</strong> And
seriously, Illinois Tech, who&#8217;s writing me the checks, hasn&#8217;t bounced a check
in who-knows-how-long, so what are they worried about? I don&#8217;t know. I hate to
say it, but I gave up. My thirty dollars is gone forever. It just wasn&#8217;t worth
it. I guess I&#8217;ll try to set up direct deposit. But with my luck, they&#8217;ll mess
it up and I&#8217;ll lose the money permanently, or have to wait even longer to have
access to it. I hate&nbsp;banks.</p>

                                    <p><a href="http://www.1up.com">1Up.com</a> is running a story called <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3116290">The Essential 50</a>, which lists what
they consider to be the 50 most essential video games. It&#8217;s an interesting
history lesson, since every entry has a short history of the game, the
innovations it had, and the impact it had on the industry and video game
development. Interestingly, several games&#8217; major impact was not technology or
innovation, as I would have imagined, but rather political and/or social.
Interesting&nbsp;stuff.</p>

                                    <p>When I received an email with the subject &#8220;American Airlines Apologizes For
Your Flight Delay,&#8221; I got a little excited. &#8220;Yes! They&#8217;ll probably offer me a
free flight or some frequent flyer miles or something! Then my hours of
meaningless waiting at the Seattle-Tacoma terminal won&#8217;t be for nought!&#8221; Alas,
it was not to be. Here&#8217;s the&nbsp;email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Tyler&nbsp;Butler,</p>
<p>On two separate occasions during the past week, we experienced technical
difficulties with our computer systems, causing some flights to be delayed. We
understand that you traveled during both periods and likely were doubly&nbsp;inconvenienced.</p>
<p>Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience you may have
experienced, and rest assured that we are working diligently to take
corrective actions. We greatly value your business, appreciate your
understanding and look forward to delivering the service you deserve in the
near&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dan Garton<br />
Executive Vice President Marketing<br />
American&nbsp;Airlines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose I was dumb to assume that there would be some sort of incentive for
me to continue my association with their airline included in the email, but
there wasn&#8217;t. As I thought about it more, I realized that flight delays are
just something you have to deal with when you fly, and the fact that I was
expecting to get something out of my suffering was a by-product of a
suffocating atmosphere of &#8220;customer-is-always-right&#8221; consumerism. So, though I
initially wanted to call them and give them a chance to offer me something, I
decided to keep my mouth&nbsp;shut.</p>
<p>Maybe I did get something after&nbsp;all?</p>

                                    <p>I came across several different articles regarding a wide variety of topics,
but they all center around Apple&#8217;s <span class="caps">OS</span>, user interface design, and the concept
of cruft. I found them to be quite interesting, and I learned a lot. I think
I&#8217;m going to force the <span class="caps">IPRO</span> 305 students to read a few of them before they
start redesigning the <a href="http://www.hawktour.net">HawkTour</a>&nbsp;interface.</p>
<h3><a href="http://64.233.179.104/search?q=cache:m1-41ZtamDcJ:mpt.phrasewise.com/stories/storyReader$374&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;strip=1">When Good Interfaces Go&nbsp;Crufty</a></h3>
<p>A good introduction to the basic concept of cruft, which, as the article
states, should be familiar to any programmer worth his salt, especially those
involved in <span class="caps">UI</span> design. Unfortunately, few programmers, let alone computer
users, realize what sort of cruft they&#8217;ve become accustomed to through regular
computer&nbsp;use.</p>
<h3><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/08/parlay">The Art of the&nbsp;Parlay</a></h3>
<p>An interesting discussion of the common belief that Apple could be Microsoft
if they&#8217;d made some different decisions in the 80&#8217;s. An interesting history
lesson, and includes some comparisons of the Apple and Microsoft approach to
product&nbsp;design.</p>
<h3><a href="http://joesacher.com/documents/commandline.php?Page=ETRE">In the Beginning was the Command&nbsp;Line</a></h3>
<p>A historical look at BeOS and how that <span class="caps">OS</span> was an attempt to attack cruft. Too
bad it failed to become popular (for various&nbsp;reasons).</p>
