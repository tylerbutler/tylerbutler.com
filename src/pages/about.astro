    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Tyler Butler. I'm a software engineer, writer, and technology enthusiast.
      This is my personal website where I share thoughts, experiences, and projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been working in software development for many years, with experience across
      web technologies, cloud platforms, and developer tools. I'm particularly interested
      in web standards, developer experience, and building tools that make other developers
      more productive.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, writing, and exploring new technologies.
      I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and contributing to the developer community.
    </p>
