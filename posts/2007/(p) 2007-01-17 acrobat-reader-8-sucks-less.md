I upgraded to Acrobat Reader 8 last night because frankly, I figured it
couldn't get any crappier than 7. I was right. In fact, it got a bit better.
The Yahoo toolbar and advertising bar across the top seem to be gone. The
interface is simpler, too. It still has automatic updating on by default, of
course, which I immediately turned off just in case the update feature sucks
as much as it did in 7.

So it's getting better. But even without Photoshop Album Starter Edition,
which it tries to bundle with the download by default (freakin' annoying, by
the way), it's still **20.8 MB**. My goodness, that's bloated...
