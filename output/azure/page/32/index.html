                                    <p><strong>Chapter 8: The Weakest&nbsp;Link</strong></p>
<p>The train didn&#8217;t seem to be moving as quickly as it had the last time he&#8217;d
ridden, mont hs ago. He was getting restless. The executives would be
expecting him momentarily. He glanced at his watch for the millionth time.
Time seemed to be slogging along at an incredibly slow&nbsp;rate.</p>
<p>The jagged cuts on his knuckles had stopped bleeding, and now pulsated a
dull pain through his entire right hand. He&#8217;d inadvertently gotten blood on
his fresh white shirt and dark tie; he probably wouldn&#8217;t have the time to
clean himself up before the meeting &#8211; if he even made&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Thee train creaked to a stop. Was this it? No, one more to go. He examined
his appearance in the low-contrast reflection of the train window. Wow, he was
a wreck; hair mussed up from the run, the gritty dull white powder of dried
sweat on his forehead, blood on his shirt, collar and tie loose and wrinkled.
He certainly didn&#8217;t look like a poster child for one of the most powerful
advertising firms in the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p>A wave of anger passed over him, largely directed at Marie. After all, it
was <em>her</em> fault that all of this was happening. If she&#8217;d made sure he was up
this morning, he could have gotten on the road earlier. Granted, it was he
that was out late last night, but <em>that</em> was her fault too. If she&#8217;d kept him
satisfied, he wouldn&#8217;t have had the need to stay out late cheating on her to
satisfy his sexual appetite. See, it was all her fault. He ought to leave her.
Well, she&#8217;d be kissing the nice house in the Glade goodbye if he didn&#8217;t get
his bonus. At least this affected her as much as it affected him &#8211; she
wouldn&#8217;t get away&nbsp;scot-free.</p>
<p>After what seemed like an eternity, the train finally made it to State
Avenue , and not a moment too soon. Mike grabbed his briefcase and hurried out
the door, pushing past the mob of people and ignoring their shouted protests
as he continued&nbsp;along.</p>
<p>The path along State Avenue to the tower was relatively clear; it was so
late in the morning, a majority of people had already made it to their jobs.
His previous physical activity had left his body reeling, and he was unable to
move faster than a brisk walk towards the tower. He pushed his way through the
revolving doors and ignored the pleasant greetings of the security guard as he
headed straight to the&nbsp;elevator.</p>
<p>He pressed the up button urgently, somehow feeling that the faster he
pressed it, the faster the elevator would descend. The pristine ding of the
elevator&#8217;s arrival could not come soon enough, and he boarded the car
anxiously. He was followed by two other nicely dressed individuals who ogled
his appearance as they boarded. He forced himself to smile smoothly, despite
his strong desire to rip their heads off. Who the hell did they think they&nbsp;were?</p>
<p>“34, please.” He murmured at the two other passengers as the doors slid to a
close with a hiss. A brief downward force signaled their ascent, and Mike
looked at his watch again. Shit, it was going to be close. The other
passengers departed at the 18 th floor, taking their time, much to Mike&#8217;s
chagrin. He pressed the door close button even more urgently than he had the
elevator call, and leaned back against the far elevator wall with an anxious
sigh. Fortunately for his sanity, it appeared no one else had any need to use
the elevator at this late morning hour, and his trip to the 34 th floor
continued&nbsp;uninterrupted.</p>
<p>The doors opened and Mike flew out frantically, briskly heading towards his
office to grab the collection of charts and mock-ups for the new&nbsp;campaign.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mr. Turner, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here! They&#8217;re waiting for you in the
conference room! Oh my, are you all right? Do you&nbsp;need&#8230;”</p>
<p>“No, Susan, just let them know I am on my way right now. I&#8217;ll be there in a
minute.” He tightened his tie and buttoned the top button of his collar, then
quickly glanced at himself in the glass reflection of his office window. Well,
this was as good as it was going to get. He pulled the rolled posters from his
desk and walked towards the conference&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>He pushed the door to the conference room open with his back, and turned to
notice that a majority of the management staff was present. That was odd &#8211; he
thought this was just between Bill, his direct supervisor, a few of the other
executives, and himself. And what was Marlene doing here? She shouldn&#8217;t have
anything do with&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mike, glad you made it&#8230; Oh, are you all right? Do you need a few
minutes?” Bill stood in&nbsp;greeting.</p>
<p>“No, no, I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span>. I just cut my hand on my way over. No big&nbsp;deal.”</p>
<p>“Well, all right then. Go ahead and have a seat.” There was something
strange in his demeanor. He was too professional, too friendly. He and Mike
were barely on speaking terms &#8211; why the charade? And what were all these
<em>people</em> doing&nbsp;here?</p>
<p>“Mike, as you know, we&#8217;re here to talk about the Richmond&nbsp;account&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I&#8217;ve got some mock-ups here for you to look at.” Mike
interrupted in excitement. He was especially proud of his ideas for the new
campaign. They were quite possibly his best, and equipped with the right team,
he could really deliver the goods on this&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>He reached down for one of the rolled-up posters and began to unfold it. “As
you can see, I&#8217;ve totally rethought the logo and how it integrates with the
rest of the campaign, and I&#8217;ve got some&nbsp;new&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Well, Mike, let&#8217;s just wait on that. You see, we&#8217;ve had a lot of discussion
about the Richmond account, and as you know, they haven&#8217;t been pleased with
the latest campaign. We rely on their business, and we really need to pick up
the pace f we want to get them to sign a new&nbsp;con&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mike was annoyed. He already knew all of this. He knew how important the
account was, both to the company and his own career. Why did Bill have to
rehash all this stuff&nbsp;here?</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know, Bill, which is why I&#8217;ve totally rethought our approach, and
if you&#8217;d just give me a second to&nbsp;exp&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Please Mike,” Bill said, holding up his hand and shaking his head. “Please
let me finish. We&#8230; all of us&#8230;” He motioned to the rest of those in the
room. “We&#8217;ve decided that we need some new leadership on the Richmond account.
Marlene, as you know, has a working relationship with some of the Richmond
guys from her days at Alliance , and we think that she might be able to
leverage that relationship to produce some good&nbsp;results.”</p>
<p>Well, that explained Marlene&#8217;s presence. “What the hell is going on, Bill?
Are you letting me go?” Mike could feel himself getting&nbsp;hot.</p>
<p>“In a word Mike&#8230; yes.” That son of a bitch. He looked around the room at
the rest of the observers. They all averted their gazes, looking at the floor
or out the window. Was this really&nbsp;happening?</p>
<p>He stood up suddenly, causing a gasp to ripple through the rest of those
present. Marlene pushed away from the table quickly. Bill stood up to meet
him, a nervous look on his face. He moved his hands slowly, obviously trying
to calm the&nbsp;situation.</p>
<p>“Now Mike, settle&nbsp;down&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mike didn&#8217;t want to settle down. He didn&#8217;t want to calm the situation. He
<em>wanted</em> to rip into&nbsp;someone.</p>
<p>“This is why you called me down here, Bill? This is the meeting you told me
about <em>two weeks</em> ago? This is what I&#8217;ve been preparing for, spending late
nights in this fucking office, cultivating and developing what is quite
possibly the most brilliant idea this firm has ever had? You son of a&nbsp;bitch!”</p>
<p>Mike advanced towards Bill. There was too much going through his head. He
couldn&#8217;t think everything through. His blood was boiling! Did they honestly
think that Marlene, that <em>bitch</em>, was going to be able to take over for him?
He was the heart of this company &#8211; Richmond was his account! What the hell
were they&nbsp;doing?</p>
<p>Bill backed away slowly, still moving his arms in a vain attempt to calm
Mike&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>“Come on Mike, you have to&nbsp;understand&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What?” Mike shouted. He was pissed now. “What do I have to understand,
Bill? Do you really think this little cunt can take the Richmond account?”
There was no answer. “Fine. Let her try!” With a roar, Mike turned and slammed
his right fist into the wall. Pain shot like hot needles through his arm, but
he didn&#8217;t&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>He turned back to where his briefcase and posters sat, leaving a streak of
maroon conspicuously on the cream conference room wall. Someone must have
called the tower security; two hefty-looking gentlemen stood in the doorway&nbsp;stolidly.</p>
<p>“Mike,” started Bill again, as Mike began to pick up his briefcase and mock-
ups. With mock-ups like these, he&#8217;d at least be able to get another&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>“Leave the stuff here. You know you can&#8217;t take it with&nbsp;you.”</p>
<p>Shit, he was right. Nothing Mike had done while working at the company was
his &#8211; it all belonged to Copeland. Those sons of bitches. He now understood
why they&#8217;d waited to tell him they&#8217;d decided to fire him; they knew he&#8217;d put
all of his energy into revamping the campaign if he thought he had an
opportunity to really change it. Now they could take his work, give it to
Marlene, and turn it into a money-making campaign. And all it cost them was
his severance&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re all sons of bitches, you know that?” He dropped the posters and
briefcase as the two stolid gentlemen grabbed his arms and led him towards the
elevators. His rage continued to mount as the elevator descended. He
considered his options. He could try to take out the two security men and go
on a rampage through the office, but sadly, he had no weapons. The men looked
pretty solid, anyway; he wouldn&#8217;t be able to take both of them&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>This sucked. No amount of profanity murmured under his breath could fully
express the sense of betrayal he felt. As the security men dragged him out of
the elevator on the ground floor, a sudden weight fell down on him. The
adrenaline that his anger had brought forth unexpectedly dissipated, and he
felt light-headed. The last thing he saw before passing out was two delivery
men wheeling a large cake through the tower lobby. The icing read,
“Congratulations&nbsp;Marlene!”</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 7:&nbsp;Shopping </strong></p>
<p>Angela ran up and down the aisles, shrieking gleefully at each brightly
colored box of food that she did not recall being there the week before.
Melissa pushed the now overflowing cart behind her rambunctious daughter,
ignoring the disapproving stares of the store employees and other customers.
She&#8217;d grown accustomed to them over the&nbsp;years.</p>
<p>“Can we get this, please?” Angela asked, throwing yet another box into the
cart before turning around quickly and running back to grab more useless
products, pony tail bobbing happily. Melissa sighed again. If she could get
paid a nickel, or even just a <em>penny</em>, for every sigh she&#8217;d uttered since
Angela&#8217;s&nbsp;birth&#8230;</p>
<p>Melissa could hardly wait until Angela was old enough to start dating. That
hellion would eat a boy for breakfast! Melissa nearly laughed out loud at the
thought of some boy seeking Angela&#8217;s affections, standing at the door with
flowers, nervous upon meeting his date&#8217;s father. Melissa chuckled again.
Someone frightened of Lawrence , ha! Whatever boy wanted to date Angela would
be in for a surprise, that was for sure. If he could handle <em>her</em>, then the
rest of the family would be a piece of&nbsp;cake.</p>
<p>Melissa shook her head sternly as Angela rounded the corner with a new box
in her hand. A shadow fell across the five-year-old&#8217;s face. The fun and games
were over, it seemed. Melissa motioned with her finger, maintaining the stern
expression on her&nbsp;face.</p>
<p>“Come on, Angie. I told you you had to settle down, and you haven&#8217;t. Come
on, up in the cart.” She motioned towards the toddler seat in the overloaded&nbsp;cart.</p>
<p>“But Mommy, I&#8217;m not a baby anymore,” Angela replied, putting on her best
pouting face. She looked pitiful, but Melissa was not falling for the act.
Lawrence might, but she was tougher than he, especially when it came to their&nbsp;daughter.</p>
<p>“Well, you certainly seem to <em>act</em> like a baby, so I think you can ride
like a baby. Come on, up you go.” She lifted the girl and placed her in the
seat. Angela crossed her arms across her chest and forced her frown to become
even more pronounced. It was comical. The entire store seemed to erupt in
silent applause at the site of the annoying blonde trapped in the toddler&nbsp;chair.</p>
<p>Melissa pushed the cart along each aisle, silently replacing each item that
Angela had placed in the cart, ignoring the small whimpers escaping her mouth
at the loss of each incredibly important item. The rest of the excursion would
transpire in silence, since Angela&#8217;s method of retribution when wronged was to
keep her mouth shut. Lawrence hated it. If he&#8217;d made her angry, he&#8217;d spend the
next hour trying to get her to talk to him, but Melissa simply ignored her.
Making her angry was often the only way to get her to shut up&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>At last the final one of Angela&#8217;s contributions to the day&#8217;s purchases was
replaced on the shelf, and Melissa double checked her short list to ensure
that she had found everything she needed. The cart seemed sparse after
removing all the superfluous items, but she had everything she needed.
Surveying the surrounding aisles quickly for any last-minute things she might
have forgotten, she turned the cart briskly and strode towards the checkout
lines, which were overpopulated with&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>“<span class="caps">OK</span>, Angela, you can have one small thing &#8211; just one. What do you&nbsp;want?”</p>
<p>The girl didn&#8217;t respond. Apparently she was still angry. Melissa shook her
head and sighed. It was her&nbsp;loss.</p>
<p>She peered around the register lanes, looking for Ned, the nice man who
always helped her to the car and always said something kind to Angela. There
he was, ringing up a constant stream of customers, as usual. The wait in his
line would be worth it. She could use a pick-me-up&nbsp;today.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ned was back in his groove. The brief break earlier had really rejuvenated
him, and he&#8217;d been visited by several of his regular customers already today,
which kept him feeling good. The pain in his knee had grown duller, and while
still present, was&nbsp;bearable.</p>
<p>He was scanning items more efficiently than he had in awhile, passing item
after item quickly over the glowing red bars of the <span class="caps">UPC</span> scanner. He had
explained once to some of the other cashiers how the scanning machine worked.
They all were amazed at his knowledge, and for a brief shining moment, he had
felt like he was himself again. A smart, respected engineer, whose knowledge
of mechanical and electrical machines was belied by his soft eyes and quiet&nbsp;demeanor.</p>
<p>Of course, Bob had quickly disbanded the small group of listeners to Ned&#8217;s
explanation, somehow turning a <span class="caps">UPC</span> scanner into a major character in the
latest episode of his corporate kiss-ass saga. Holly had been kind enough to
listen to his further explanation during one of their mutual breaks. She had
seemed genuinely interested, though Ned knew she had promptly forgotten
everything he&#8217;d said. It didn&#8217;t matter. She&#8217;d given him the chance to feel
smart and useful again, and that was what he&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>Ned often spent his breaks chatting with Holly when he could. They often sat
out on bench in the parking lot, while Holly smoked a cigarette. She never
failed to offer one to Ned, though he always declined. Truth be told, he found
the habit disgusting and repulsive, but Holly was interesting to be around,
and her presence offset the acrid smell of the smoke. In fact, there were
several things that Ned disapproved of about Holly, and if she had been his
daughter, they certainly would have a lot to discuss. But she wasn&#8217;t his
daughter, and as their work relationship turned into a true friendship, he
found that the eyebrow piercing and smoking habit defined their relationship
less and&nbsp;less.</p>
<p>He was constantly astounded by her generosity. She often invited the beggars
standing outside to join her for a snack, and always listened to their stories
of heartache and longing. That was her real gift to them, whether they
realized it or not &#8211; the gift of a listening, interested ear. Anyone could
give them a piece of pizza or the loose change in their pocket, but Holly&#8217;s
genuine concern for them and inquiries about their well-being lasted longer
than both the food and the loose&nbsp;change.</p>
<p>Ned knew that many of the homeless men and women that frequented the area
surrounding the store were residents, either permanent or otherwise, of the
St. Ives shelter. He had mentioned to Holly that she should consider
volunteering there or something, but she seemed reluctant. She always just
smiled and said, “Yeah, Ned, I know,” but to his knowledge, she never had even
set foot in the&nbsp;shelter.</p>
<p>He shot a glance to register 7, where Holly was now busy ringing up her own
long line of customers. She caught his glance and smiled. He smiled back. He
might hate his job, but at least he had to opportunity to become friends with
good&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>“Thanks a lot, Ned. I&#8217;ll see you next&nbsp;week.”</p>
<p>“You too, Mark. Be careful on the way out, it&#8217;s a bit slick by the door,” he
replied, referring to the small puddle of soda, remnants of an overactive
bottle of&nbsp;Sprite.</p>
<p>He looked up to identify his next customer, and groaned inwardly as he saw
Melissa and Angela. Melissa was nice enough, but her daughter was a brat. Ned
had seen the way Melissa and Lawrence doted on her every whim, and it made him
sick. If _she&#8217;d _ been his daughter &#8211; well, he was just glad she wasn&#8217;t. He&#8217;d
have picked Holly over her any&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>“Hi, Ned! How&#8217;ve you been?” Melissa inquired cheerfully, her smile
contradicted by the obvious tension and exhaustion in her&nbsp;voice.</p>
<p>“Oh, I&#8217;m fine, fine. And your&nbsp;husband?”</p>
<p>“He had to work today. It&#8217;s just me and&nbsp;Angie.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. And how are you, little miss?” He smiled, eyes peeking over the
edge of his nose at the girl who looked very angry, arms crossed defiantly
across her&nbsp;chest.</p>
<p>“Fine,” she replied, not looking&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>He began to scan the items on the small conveyor belt. He knew that would
get Angie&#8217;s attention. She was always intrigued by the speed at which he
loaded the bags, so much faster than any other&nbsp;cashier.</p>
<p>Today was no exception. As the <em>beep</em>, <em>beep</em>, <em>beep</em>, of the scanned
items reverberated in the echoic store, Angela became transfixed on Ned&#8217;s
hands. They seemed to blur as he scanned and bagged each item with lightning&nbsp;speed.</p>
<p>Ned grinned at her, willing his arms to move even faster, mentally
confirming that every item had scanned by carefully listening for the
confirmation beep. He was going <em>fast</em>&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, his hands faltered. The jar of peanut butter, fortunately
plastic, flew from his fingers and clattered loudly on the tiled floor. The
store seemed to freeze; the all of the customers&#8217; attention was focused on
him, and him&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p>The silence was broken by Angela&#8217;s childish laughter. She clapped her hands
with glee, apparently deriving some sadistic pleasure from Ned&#8217;s mistake. Ned,
speechless at this unexpected development, knelt down silently and picked up
the jar. He scanned it again and continued, moving more slowly and del
iberately this&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The rest of the store reanimated itself, and Ned glanced up again to see
Holly still looking his direction. Her eyes asked, “Are you <span class="caps">OK</span>?” He nodded
back at her and painted his smile back on before looking back up at&nbsp;Melissa.</p>
<p>“Well, will there be anything else for you this&nbsp;morning?”</p>
<p>“No, Ned, that&#8217;ll be all. How much do I owe&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>“Well, you owe me a smile, but the store will want $87.13.” Ned joked back,
trying to shake off the embarrassment he felt at having dropped the peanut
butter. Melissa&nbsp;grinned.</p>
<p>“Well, here&#8217;s your smile, and here&#8217;s the check for the store. Can I trust
you to make sure they get&nbsp;it?”</p>
<p>“But of course,” he replied. “Would you like some help getting out to your&nbsp;car?”</p>
<p>“Well&#8230; Actually, yes, that&#8217;d be&nbsp;great.”</p>
<p>Ned glanced around, looking for one of the young cart collectors to help
Melissa, but there were none to be found. Oh well. “I&#8217;ll be right back,
everyone.” He flipped the light on his register off and limped along behind
Melissa to her car, ignoring the faces Angela made at him as they walked. He&#8217;d
be glad when they were gone, especially the little&nbsp;brat.</p>
<p>Melissa opened the trunk and Ned quickly loaded the bags into it with his
strong arms, oblivious to the sound of sirens as they passed along the street
in front of the&nbsp;store.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 6:&nbsp;Disembarkation </strong></p>
<p>Joel didn&#8217;t notice when the man he&#8217;d held the train for stepped off. He was
more interested in sleeping at that point. The metal bar alongside the train
seat wasn&#8217;t the most comfortable pillow he&#8217;d ever used, but it wasn&#8217;t the most
uncomfortable either. The mounting fatigue of the trip had finally overwhelmed
him and he would have slept&nbsp;anywhere.</p>
<p>Lucky for him, the McAllister Park stop was the last, and the train operator
woke him with a harsh clap on the shoulder and a shout, looking less than
pleased. Joel smiled sheepishly and rubbed his eyes as he was pushed out onto
the&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>The sun was looming higher in the sky now, and it was beginning to warm up.
His bare arms and legs felt quite comfortable as he twisted from side to side,
stretching his stiff body. He drew in a deep breath, let it out slowly, and
began walking towards the&nbsp;exit.</p>
<p>He considered briefly walking straight home. His apartment wasn&#8217;t far, and
he <em>was</em> tired. But looking around him, he realized that days as beautiful as
this one were in short supply here at this time of year, and he should make
the best of it while he could. Besides, he could really use a bagel &#8211; he
hadn&#8217;t had one while he&#8217;d been in&nbsp;Asia.</p>
<p>He had sampled much of the local cuisine &#8211; a variety of curried rice,
countless vegetables, and fruits that few western mouths had tasted. But the
simplicity of a bagel slathered with cream cheese was something he had missed
greatly during his&nbsp;absence.</p>
<p>It took him a moment to get his bearings. Things hadn&#8217;t changed that much
since his departure, but months of trekking through real jungle had left him
unready to tackle the asphalt&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>He set off east the opposite of his apartment, heading towards the
Dominick&#8217;s that serviced all of McAllister Park&#8217;s grocery needs. He&#8217;d suffered
a little culture shock during his return flight, largely due to the wide array
of various items that were made available in even the smallest airport
convenience shop. Dominick&#8217;s was sure to shock him even&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>The streets appeared to him much cleaner than when he last saw them. It was
certainly an observation colored by his experiences with much dirtier streets
in Asia. Most any street would appear cleaner than&nbsp;those.</p>
<p>He soon settled into a now familiar stride, born of countless hours spent
hiking in secluded mountain jungles and vast grassy valleys. The distance to
the store was more than an average American would consider walkable, but then,
Joel was no longer an average American, was&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>A few children passed by on bikes, sending inquisitive glances his direction
as they sped by. They probably didn&#8217;t see too many young men walking along the
streets of McAllister Park. It wasn&#8217;t known as the best neighborhood in the
city. Joel had ended up here just because it was cheap, and he&#8217;d never had any
real problems. Every once in awhile you&#8217;d hear of someone getting beat up, or
a bike getting stolen, or something, but Joel just did his best to be careful
and didn&#8217;t let himself get too worked up about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He had sublet his apartment to a young couple that were still in school
relative close by. They were strapped for cash, and he didn&#8217;t really want to
give up his lease because of the trip. They had agreed to be out of the
apartment by a month before Joel&#8217;s scheduled return, so by now the place would
probably require a thorough cleaning. The bed, though, would be clean enough
for a good night&#8217;s rest &#8211; no need to concern himself with that&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>What he did need to concern himself with was getting food. His stomach&#8217;s
complaints grew audible as he crossed the nearly abandoned parking lot of
Dominick&#8217;s. He entered through the automatic doors and thought idly how lazy
people had&nbsp;become.</p>
<p>The scent of fresh-baked bread beckoned his nose frantically upon entry to
the store. It didn&#8217;t take him long to find the bakery section of the store,
despite his unfamiliarity with the new configuration of the store. It was much
different that when he last saw it, but he let his nose do the leading, and
all was&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>He pulled a large plain white bagel from an oversized bin and smiled as he
imagined the joy he was about to experience while consuming it. He considered
briefly buying a few more items while he was there, but he he hadn&#8217;t had a
chance to convert any of his larger foreign currency, and the change in his
pocket was barely enough to cover his&nbsp;bagel.</p>
<p>The line at the register was much longer than he had anticipated given the
deserted parking lot. A man with graying hair and a Dominick&#8217;s smock motioned
at him as he walked past the registers. The man seemed a little weak on his
legs, but he hobbled over and flipped the light on his register back&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>“Good morning, sir,” he said, smiling slightly and quickly typing in the
code for bakery goods. “Will that be all for&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I&#8217;m just a little hungry,” Joel replied, smiling back. “Just got off a
long plane&nbsp;trip.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, I see. Was it a good&nbsp;trip?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so. I certainly learned a&nbsp;lot.”</p>
<p>“Good to hear, good to hear. Well, enjoy your bagel, and have a nice&nbsp;day.”</p>
<p>“You too&#8230;” Joel glanced at the man&#8217;s name tag. “&#8230;Ned. I&#8217;ll see you
later.” They both smiled at each other again. Joel was grateful for the
conversation. The man sounded tired, but he had made a concerted effort to be
friendly and engage with Joel. It was a quality he hadn&#8217;t seen a lot of since
his return, and it was something he knew he&#8217;d miss from his&nbsp;trip.</p>
<p><em>[Insert another Asia back story&nbsp;here.]</em></p>
<p>He exited the store and began making his way back towards his apartment. The
bagel was heavenly delicious, and for a time he became so lost in its flavor
that he didn&#8217;t pay attention to where he was going. When he finally realized
he&#8217;d missed a turn and was headed down the wrong street, it had turned eerily
quiet and deserted. The sudden lack of sound struck him as strange, and he
peered around in a vain attempt to get his&nbsp;bearings.</p>
<p>It was not in Joel&#8217;s nature to get nervous, but something about the air made
the hairs on the back of his neck stand at full attention. He felt for a
moment like a lawman from the wild west, stepping out into the main street of
a seemingly deserted town, expecting ambush, but not knowing from where it
would come. A newspaper, floating lazily by on the breeze, so tumbleweed-like,
did nothing to erase the image from his&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>In the silence, the unexpected <strong>bang! </strong> from the east was startlingly
stentorian. His mind stumbled for a moment &#8211; was it a shot, a firecracker, or
what? Then he just started running, not really knowing why. Instead of running
away from the sound, he ran <em>towards</em> it. It didn&#8217;t make much sense, he knew,
but he felt that east was the only direction that made sense to run in. He
couldn&#8217;t explain it, and the question of why he ran towards it instead of away
would later plague him, but for now, he was&nbsp;running.</p>
<p>As he drew closer to the source of the sound, voices became&nbsp;clearer.</p>
<p>“Holy shit, man! Why&#8217;d you do&nbsp;that?”</p>
<p>“I wasn&#8217;t tryin&#8217; to hit him! He jumped out of the way&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230;&nbsp;Shit!”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;d better get the hell out of here,&nbsp;man.”</p>
<p>Joel emerged from an alley and saw what had transpired. Two men, the
apparent sources of the screaming, were standing in the opposite corner of the
alley, facing a dumpster, hands waving animatedly. One held a gun. Well, that
answered his question about what caused the&nbsp;bang.</p>
<p>Joel froze in his tracks almost immediately, but the men noticed him quickly
and he soon found himself eying the barrel of the&nbsp;pistol.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t move, man.&nbsp;Shit!”</p>
<p>“Come on Charlie, let&#8217;s get out of&nbsp;here!”</p>
<p>“No man, he&#8217;s seen us, he can <span class="caps">ID</span>&nbsp;us.”</p>
<p>“Just forget it, Charlie. Come on, let&#8217;s go. We&#8217;re already in deep shit&nbsp;man.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and this&#8217;ll make it&nbsp;worse.”</p>
<p>Both men approached Joel slowly; Joel stood&nbsp;frozen.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry, guys&#8230; I won&#8217;t say a thing&#8230; I just took a wrong turn, you
know. I just want to get home&#8230; Either one of you know where Western is from
here?” He tried to steady the shaking in his voice. Who&#8217;d have thought having
a gun pointed at you could reduce you to jelly so&nbsp;quickly?</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know where Western is,” replied the man with the gun. “But I think
you&#8217;ll be needin&#8217; more than directions to get&nbsp;there.”</p>
<p>Joel didn&#8217;t even hear the shot. He was suddenly on the ground, a sharp pain
in his belly, nausea washing over him. He blinked and tried to focus as the
men turned and ran, feet pounding hard on the&nbsp;asphalt.</p>
<p>“Shit! Charlie, you&#8217;re a fuckin&#8217;&nbsp;idiot!”</p>
<p>Joel groaned. His head was swimming. What had happened? He looked down at
his stomach and was surprised to see a hole that hadn&#8217;t been there before.
Where did that come from? He tried to stand, but found any attempt to use his
abdominal muscles sent wave after wave of pain coursing through his&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>He rolled over, and that&#8217;s when he noticed the crooked body beyond the
dumpster. It wasn&#8217;t moving. Joel steeled himself against the pain and pushed
upwards with one hand, using the other to hold his aching stomach. His mind
still wasn&#8217;t entirely clear, but he knew he had to help the other guy crumpled
there and get himself some help. He put his left arm under the man&#8217;s shoulder
and lifted upward with all his might, keeping his right hand pressed against
his&nbsp;abdomen.</p>
<p>The blood ran out over his fingers and dropped silently onto the asphalt as
he dragged himself and his new companion out of the alley. He didn&#8217;t know
where he was headed &#8211; he hoped the right direction. He made it about a block
before an unexpected wave of lightheadedness hit him. He was suddenly falling
towards a field of daffodils and butterflies, and then,&nbsp;nothing.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 4:&nbsp;Mike</strong></p>
<p>_Come on, come on&#8230; Just start already! _Another wheeze and gasp from the
engine, but it still wouldn&#8217;t fully turn over. “Dammit!” Mike shouted as he
smashed his right fist down against the front dashboard, cracking the brittle,
sun-bleached plastic of the air&nbsp;vents.</p>
<p>The day had not been going well. Come to think of it, the week, the month,
the <em>year</em> had not been going well. But today had been especially trying.
Marie had given him crap again for coming in late last night, he&#8217;d overslept
and got on the highway later than he&#8217;d hoped (no thanks to Marie, who hadn&#8217;t
been persistent enough in making roll out of bed), and now the car was <em>not</em>&nbsp;cooperating.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous. Any other day but this one! Today was important! Today
was the meeting about the Richmond account &#8211; his account. An account that he
had nursed from its infancy at Copeland. An account that he had brought to the
company himself. Copeland didn&#8217;t even know Richmond <em>existed</em> until he&#8217;d
brought it in. And he&#8217;d turned the account into a cash cow. Mike Turner was
totally responsible for turning Copeland Advertising into a large, well-
respected firm, and he wasn&#8217;t getting any credit at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Not enough, anyway. And these new executives &#8211; young enough to be his
children &#8211; were coming in, acting like _they&#8217;d _ built the company, yanking
his talented staff away and putting them under other, less adept leaders. Then
they had the audacity to complain when the returns on the Richmond account
weren&#8217;t as high as usual. How could he be expected to produce results when
they were giving crappy, unskilled kids to work with? Most of these kids
didn&#8217;t know Z-Form advertising from their ass. And he was expected not only to
train them, but use them to produce high-quality advertising for the company&#8217;s
biggest account. Yeah, right, the logic made&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>And these kids &#8211; all they knew how to do was use a computer. If they
couldn&#8217;t do it digitally, they couldn&#8217;t do it. Not an ounce of artistic talent
between them. They only knew how to click a few buttons, move a cursor around
a screen, and hit the print key. Mike had come in with a few physical mock-ups
and these kids were amazed. “This must have taken you so long,” they
exclaimed. Damn kids, with their skateboards, their body-art, their Japanese
anime bullshit. They didn&#8217;t know jack about advertising. How the hell did they
get&nbsp;degrees?</p>
<p>Today was the day he was going to fix the problems. The bigwigs upstairs
wanted to talk Richmond , and Mike was ready. He&#8217;d prepared several new ideas
for the account, and had outlined a plan to rejuvenate Copeland&#8217;s advertising
efforts. He&#8217;d even formulated a sound argument to get some of the more
seasoned staff back on his team. Surely they could listen to reason. After
all, it was the least the company could do for him. And the Richmond guys were
ready to sign a contract renewal, provided Mike could produce some quality
mock-ups for the new campaign. A renewed contract meant a bonus for Mike &#8211; a
bonus he desperately&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>But now the damn car wouldn&#8217;t start. He&#8217;d asked Marie three weeks ago to
take it to the mechanic while he was at work, but apparently she hadn&#8217;t. She
wasn&#8217;t good for much of anything these days. She was a decent cook, though,
and he kept her around as a back-up if he couldn&#8217;t get any from the younger,
more lithe interns. A man had needs,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Besides, in his occupation, he needed a wife &#8211; someone he could bring to
company functions and provide his account-holders a sense of stability and
constancy. The latest in a string of vacuous office biddies wasn&#8217;t the best
choice for a dinner companion if clients were present; they needed to see him
as reliable, honest, and consistent, even if none of those words had ever
accurately described&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous. The anger of the surrounding drivers on the highway was
mounting quickly, and they sped by him honking their horns and screaming
obscenities in his general direction. What was he going to do? He could call a
tow truck, but by the time they arrived and he made it downtown, he&#8217;d have
missed the meeting and his opportunity to get things back on track at Copeland
would be gone. He already felt he was on thin ice with many of the executives
– he couldn&#8217;t afford to make a bad impression at this&nbsp;meeting.</p>
<p>So what was he going to do? He slammed his fist on the dash again, sending
pieces of broken plastic flying, and dialed Marie on his cell. No answer.
Where the hell was she? There was absolutely no reason she wouldn&#8217;t be picking
up this early in the morning. Dammit, <em>dammit</em>, <strong><em>dammit</em></strong>! He hit the
dash three more times for emphasis, this time driving plastic splinters into
his knuckles. He didn&#8217;t care. He had to get&nbsp;downtown.</p>
<p>There was more riding on this meeting than anyone realized. He <em>needed</em>
that bonus, and in order to get the bonus, had had to convince the execs to
give him his old team back. And to do that, he <em>had</em> to get to the meeting!
It was a chain of events, all connected and reliant on the other, and he
couldn&#8217;t afford to screw any one of them up at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>In a moment of sudden clarity, Mike noticed the train track to his left,
running parallel to the highway. How close was he to a station? He could see
the outline of the Whoorsley station in the distance ahead of him. Could he
make it on foot? He glanced back and saw the light of an approaching train
pulling to a stop at the faraway Allerton stop. He&#8217;d have to chance&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He threw the door of his black Mercedes open, grabbed his briefcase, and
dodged oncoming traffic and verbal assaults over to the shoulder. He briefly
looked back at the car; he&#8217;d probably never see it again, but it was a small
price to&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>He loosened his tie and began to run towards Whoorsley as fast as he could.
He hadn&#8217;t run like this since college, and his body apparently took great
pleasure in reminding him of that fact with burning lungs, rubbery legs, and
the complexion of a pickled beet. And this was only the first hundred&nbsp;feet.</p>
<p>The train passed him with about 1000 feet left. He felt as if his lungs were
going to explode, but he kept going. He had to. Mike was not a religious man;
he hadn&#8217;t prayed since he was a small child kneeling at his bedside, hands
folded, but he prayed harder than he ever had that something, some <em>one</em>,
would make that train wait. If he could make it, he might be able to make it
all the way downtown and still have a few minutes to take the elevator up to
the&nbsp;office.</p>
<p>And the train waited. Time just seemed to stop. The rest of the world kept
moving, but that train was rooted, statue-like, at the Whoorsley station. Mike
kept running, sweat pouring from his brow, legs numb, lungs pumping furiously,
blood oozing from the dashboard-incurred injury he hadn&#8217;t even noticed yet. He
made it to the rear car and literally fell into it. The passengers looked at
him strangely, but he didn&#8217;t care. He&#8217;d made it, somehow. Perhaps this day
wasn&#8217;t going to be so bad after&nbsp;all.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: The&nbsp;Corner</strong></p>
<p>Ernie stepped his way back along Sullivan Street . The music was roaring in
his ears again. The walk would get him warmed up; he&#8217;d be more than prepared
to take on the kids at 34 th and Broadway by the time he&nbsp;arrived.</p>
<p>Some of the kids on “the corner,” as it was known to those in the elite
circle of participants, resented Ernie&#8217;s presence, but no one could deny that
he could move. Ken was sure to set straight anyone who argued about Ernie&#8217;s
participation. Ken understood that despite appearances, Ernie wasn&#8217;t a grown-
up, and the rest of the kids had nothing to fear from&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>A rising rhythm in the music caused a requisite wave to ripple through
Ernie&#8217;s body. He loved that part of the song. In a sudden burst of
inspiration, he jumped up, spun 180 degrees and landed on his back heels,
still moving the same direction. A new move! He didn&#8217;t discover that many
anymore. He&#8217;d have to try that out at the corner today. It would drive the
kids nuts &#8211; especially&nbsp;Karen.</p>
<p>Ken teased Ernie all the time about his crush on Karen. He tried to deny it,
but he had to admit to himself that it was true. There was something about the
way she shook her body while out on the floor, moved her hips back and forth,
and seemed to look right through him when their eyes met&#8230; he grinned. She
should be there today, and armed with a new move, he was sure to impress&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>He rounded the corner and made his way along the Dominick&#8217;s parking lot. He
stole a glance in the storefront window, searching for the nice girl with the
blonde hair and a metal bar in her eye. Ernie had always found the piercing
strange &#8211; why someone would do that to their body was beyond his comprehension
– but she had been friendly to him, providing him with the occasional sandwich
or soda on a warm day, so he eventually accepted the shiny metal accessory as
a part of&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>She was kind to all the residents, past and present, of St. Ives, and many
others that had never set foot there. She always had some spare change, a kind
word, or a candy bar, or <em>something</em>. She often brought a pizza out on her
lunch brea k and dined with the less fortunate in the lot, or, during the
winner, brought small mugs of del iciously warm hot chocolate for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Ernie could nev er remember her name, but he&#8217;d nev er forget her face. She
always took the time to talk to him when she could, and he appreciated it. She
reminded him of Rho nda, but he could nev er remember her name. She&#8217;d told it
to him many times, but it wouldn&#8217;t stick. She always giggled when he repeated
it countless times in her presence to make sure he&#8217;d know it for next time.
Perhaps he forgot it just so he could make her laugh again the next time they&nbsp;met.</p>
<p>There she was in the store, scanning items over the laser reader and smiling
at the customers. She didn&#8217;t see him, but he didn&#8217;t have time to try and get
her attention. Ken would be waiting at the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>In fact, Ken came out to meet him a couple blocks before the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ern, didja hear?” Ernie nodded in&nbsp;confusion.</p>
<p>“Somethin&#8217;s going on down by the store. Cops and everything! Come on, lets
go check it out!” Ken whizzed by on his bike, made a wide u-turn, and pedaled
up beside&nbsp;Ernie.</p>
<p>“Man, I hope we can see somethin&#8217;. Maybe there&#8217;ll be a body and everything!
Wouldn&#8217;t that be awesome?” Ernie wasn&#8217;t entirely sure he was ready to witness
a dead body. He certainly wasn&#8217;t as excited as Ken, but with something this
exciting going on, it was doubtful anyone would be at the corner&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The fla shing red and blue of the emergency vehicles were visible a few
blocks from the convenience store. Ken sped up and pedaled on ahead, leaving
Ernie alone with his thoughts for a few moments. All he really wanted to do
was jive down on the corner. Maybe he should just go back towards St. Ives and
jive by himself for the day. No, eventually the kids would get bored or
realize they weren&#8217;t going to see anything, and the corner would ramp back up
to it&#8217;s usual buzz of activity. He&#8217;d just have to wait it&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>As he approached Ken&#8217;s chosen vantage point, men in blue police uniforms
were wheeling a gurney into the back of an&nbsp;ambulance.</p>
<p>“Well, they ain&#8217;t in no hurry. He must already be dead. Come on, let&#8217;s go
take a look!” Ernie groaned inwardly, but followed Ken as he clandestinely cut
up the alley behind the store and emerged beside the nearly deserted far side
of the&nbsp;ambulance.</p>
<p>“Come on, Ern, lift me up,” Ken whispered, gesturing at the small side
window of the ambulance. Ernie grasped Ken under his arms and heaved him
towards the window, holding him steady as he himself peeked in the&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>Ernie dropped Ken hard on the pavement as his vision cleared and he
recognized who it was on the&nbsp;gurney.</p>
<p>It was&nbsp;Darryl.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 3:&nbsp;Joel</strong></p>
<p>“&#8230;like to thank you for flying with American Airlines. We know you have a
choice when you fly and we&#8217;re glad you chose American. Enjoy your stay, and we
hope to fly again with you&nbsp;soon.”</p>
<p>Joel stirred from his light slumber and stretched his arms above him in a
wide arc. Finally, the flight was over. It was about time, too. Fourteen hours
on the plane had left him stiff, tired, and certainly not the most pleasant to
be around. But the trip was over. He wasn&#8217;t in a particular hurry to get off
the plane, so he sat back and allowed the rest of the crowd to clamor for
their&nbsp;bags.</p>
<p>That was one of many things he&#8217;d learned this trip. Time was simply not as
important as everyone seemed to think it was. Waiting patiently ten minutes
for a majority of the passengers to clear out would not negatively impact
one&#8217;s life beyond repair. But if the frenzied approach of the other passengers
was any indication, this particular philosophy was certainly not the most
popular. At least it was different&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>Joel closed his eyes and smiled, leaning his head back against the
uncomfortable hard foam of the seat. It had been a good trip. He&#8217;s learned a
<em>lot</em>, about <em>everything</em>. He didn&#8217;t know whether it was more incredible
that it had come to an end or that it had even started in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>When he&#8217;d graduated high school, he&#8217;d never imagined he&#8217;d take a trip like
this. Many of his friends traveled to Europe for that summer before college,
but Joel hadn&#8217;t been able to afford it. He&#8217;d attended St. Ignatius College
Prep on a merit scholarship, and unlike most attendees, didn&#8217;t have a trust
fund. His father owned a gas station, his mother was a seamstress, and pretty
much everything about Joel&#8217;s life contrasted starkly with that of his
classmates at St.&nbsp;Ig&#8217;s.</p>
<p>But Joel was a whiz with numbers. They just made sense to him. He couldn&#8217;t
draw, he couldn&#8217;t sing, and he spelled at about a third-grade level, but he
could do wonders with numbers. At St. Ig&#8217;s, he had been led through the
magical world of mathematics by Dr. Alan Sparrow, who had impressed upon Joel
the fact that math was&nbsp;everywhere.</p>
<p>It was a fact that opened up an entire universe of opportunities to Joel.
After he realized that there were few things in life that couldn&#8217;t be broken
down mathematically, his entire world began to make sense. He began to compose
music mathematically, writing entire symphonies and handing them out to
friends to play on real instruments, because he didn&#8217;t play any himself. He
created complex formulas that, when graphed, produced wonderful works of art.
He turned his entire world into numbers, and he&nbsp;excelled.</p>
<p>During his senior year at St. Ig&#8217;s, Joel met his first girlfriend, Sara.
They hit it off immediately, and began dating exclusively after two weeks of
knowing each other. For awhile, life was good. But eventually, as he did with
all things, Joel began to analyze their relationship statistically, attempting
to find the magic formula that would allow him to make sense of the complex
interactions between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>At first, Sara was amused and intrigued by Joel&#8217;s approach. His analytical
mind had been a major contributor in her attraction him from the start, and
his fascination with her <em>mathematically</em> was, in her words, “cute.”
Increasingly, though, Sara began to resent her role as a mere variable in
Joel&#8217;s increasingly complex formula. It became clear to her that Joel was
simply running an elaborate experiment, and she was the guinea pig. He didn&#8217;t
seem to care about her at all except in the context of his attempt to quantify
human interactions. So, in the middle of their final semester at St. Ig&#8217;s, she
explained to him that their relationship, such as it was, was&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Sara had not been totally correct about Joel&#8217;s feelings towards her. In
reality, Joel cared very much for her. His “experiment,” as she termed it, was
really his attempt to figure the relationship out and put it into a context
that he could understand. He had a burning need to know exactly what action he
should perform in a given scenario in their relationship, and Sara simply
wasn&#8217;t telling&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>He was beside himself with depression after the breakup. His statistical
model had never, <em>ever</em>, predicted this outcome. Sara should be enthralled by
him &#8211; he was doing <em>everything right</em>! Wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>The failure of his model to predict the breakup was a source of great
distress for Joel. It meant only one of two things; either he had made a
mistake in his abstractions or calculations, or human interaction simply
couldn&#8217;t be analyzed in terms of mathematics. Both options made him shudder.
He was fairly certain he hadn&#8217;t made any mathematical mistakes, which left
only&#8230; Joel hadn&#8217;t been able to come to terms with the possibility that he
wouldn&#8217;t be able to arithmetize human&nbsp;sociality.</p>
<p>The emotional repercussions of the unexpected breakup did not contribute
positively to his situation, so Joel had consoled himself by throwing himself
into college preparations. He&#8217;d already been accepted and was enrolled, so he
found out what classes he&#8217;d be taking, and spent most of his days that summer
in the local library reading the text books and other material for his
classes. In retrospect, it probably wasn&#8217;t the best decision. During his first
semester at college, he became <em>very</em> bored, <em>very</em> quickly. His above-
average intelligence combined with the foreknowledge of most of the material
forced him to look for other things &#8211; some of them good, most of them bad &#8211; to
keep himself&nbsp;occupied.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before Joel realized that more schooling simply wasn&#8217;t in the
cards for him. The nagging suspicion that mathematics weren&#8217;t everything just
wouldn&#8217;t go away, and he didn&#8217;t feel as though he were truly learning anything
in his classes that he couldn&#8217;t learn in a&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>He dropped out after his freshman year with no plans, no job, and
realistically, no real future. His uncle owned a lawn mowing business, and
Joel eventually began working there. It wasn&#8217;t especially difficult work, but
it kept Joel busy, and he had plenty of time to contemplate the questions that
were plaguing him about his approach to&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for him to realize that he needed to get out and
experience the world if he wanted to try and understand it. That realization
gave birth to the trip he was now returning&nbsp;from.</p>
<p>He had saved pennies for two years to afford it. Two years of ramen,
weekends spent reading instead of going to the movies, and shirking vacation
time in favor of overtime pay. Two years of blood, sweat, and tears for this –
the trip of a&nbsp;lifetime.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Joel, the trip was all he had imagined it would be and more.
He had hiked through countless mountains, seen wonders he never thought
existed, and had met so many <em>good</em> people. The cultures of the places he had
been were so much friendlier, so much more, he thought, evolved. His smile
grew broader as he leaned back on the airline seat again and remembered the
sheer incredibility of it all. He had done&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>His thoughts were brought back to the present by the sudden realization that
all was quiet. He opened his eyes and glanced around. Nary a soul was present,
save a woman and her two uncooperative children in the section behind him. He
found his backpack, the sole possession he had with him and ambled towards the
exit of the&nbsp;plane.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of the airport terminal was another wake-up call. It
was now clear that he was far from the quiet jungles from which he had
recently departed. Everyone seemed in such a hurry. People brushed by him
roughly, not even stopping to apologize. It was strange, the difference
between the attitudes of those he&#8217;d met in his travels and the people that now
surrounded&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>It was a transition that he had noticed on this return trip. He had had some
trouble with his tickets on the return flight. The airline in Thailand had
suggested that he confirm his reservations with the local agent at each stop
along his itinerary, so he did. At most stops, the agents were helpful,
friendly, and understanding. One even made several frantic phone calls and
escorted him personally to his gate to make sure he made his&nbsp;flight.</p>
<p>As if he&#8217;d crossed some invisible line, the agents on the American side of
the world turned snobbish, were far less than helpful, and seemed determined
to make interaction with them a living hell. And that was only part of it. The
passengers on the domestic flights were closed off as well &#8211; they seemed to
actively avoid all contact with other passengers, content rather to cower
under their blankets and read the in-flight magazines. Joel had, on several
occasions, attempted to start a friendly conversation during a flight or while
waiting at a gate, but he was always pushed away. He had a lot of adjusting to
do before he&#8217;d feel at home again in this&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>He arrived at the terminal train station just as a shuttle was departing. Oh
well, no matter. He&#8217;d just get the next one. Stepping outside, he realized
he&#8217;d forgotten how cold the city could be at this time of year. It was in fact
quite warm, relative to the usual temperature of the city, but the gentle wind
against his bare legs and sandaled feet only accentuated the remaining chill
he had from the frosty airplane cabin. Yet another thing he&#8217;d have to readjust&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Looking around him, he noticed several other travelers standing on the
platform, donned in light autumn jackets, each one with a serious expression,
talking on a cell phone and smoking a cigarette. Everyone seemed so isolated –
he wondered for a moment if perhaps two of the people standing there were
perhaps talking to each other, not realizing that they were in fact less then
twenty feet apart. It wouldn&#8217;t be that surprising. None of them looked at each
other. They were too engrossed in their own private conversations to care bout
or notice the rest of the world around&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Joel decided to take a short stroll around the platform while he waited. The
conversations he overheard were topically different, but equally indicative of
worried, frightened&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>“I know I&#8217;m late, Gerald. You don&#8217;t have to keep telling me. If the damn
plane had been on time, I would have made it. Well, you&#8217;ll just have to
without me for the time being. Yes, I have the portfolio. I&#8217;ll&nbsp;bring&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Did you get Mikey to school? Is he feeling better? What did the doctor say?
Was he sure it was just a cold? I&nbsp;thought&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;got me thinking, you know? I mean, it was just a little fender-bender,
no big deal, right? But the insurance company is saying that they might not
cover it, and the mechanic is charging me my left nut to get it realigned.
Yeah, I&nbsp;know&#8230;”</p>
<p>Joel shook his head. So many things to worry about &#8211; so many things to push
out of proportion. He silently wished he was back in Asia . Things seemed a
lot simpler over there. He chuckled. He was “home” less than an hour and
already complaining. That made him a true America n,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>The train pulled up and Joel stepped on behind a tired-looking woman pulling
three large suitcases. She was trying to pull them,&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>“Could I give you a hand, ma&#8217;am?” Joel asked, placing a hand on the largest
of the three and preparing to pull it up into the train. Confused, the woman
gave Joel a quick visual appraisal and apparently judged him unworthy of the&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>“No, no, I&#8217;m fine, I&#8217;m fine. Just leave me&nbsp;alone.”</p>
<p>Joel shrugged as she moved as quickly as she could to the opposite side of
the train, sat down, and eyed him warily.&nbsp;Whatever.</p>
<p>As the train began to move towards its downtown destination, Joel found an
empty seat and sat down, peering out the window at the cars passing on the
highway alongside him. Every driver had the same serious expression as the
commuters at the station. Eyes gazing straight ahead, hands clenching the
steering wheel tightly, lead foot on the accelerator. Everyone had somewhere
to be,&nbsp;apparently.</p>
<p>Joel distracted himself by watching the autumn leaves perform complex
acrobatics in the winds above the highway. The seasons were one thing that
he&#8217;d missed while he was away. He didn&#8217;t much care for winter, and spring was
his favorite, but autumn, with its falling leaves, grey skies and clear
moonlit nights, held a special allure for him as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>He smiled to himself as he realized he&#8217;d been absent-mindedly contemplating
the physics governing the leaves movements, and reflecting on the equations
behind them. He hadn&#8217;t changed <em>that</em> much on his trip, had&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>_[Insert more Asia back story here.]&nbsp;_</p>
<p>At Allerton, the traffic on the highway had come to a complete stop. Joel
soon discovered the reason. A car was abandoned in the center lane, driver
door swung open. The drivers rolled down their windows and cursed, at who they
didn&#8217;t know, and abruptly cut off their rant when they noticed the car was
empty. The combined symphony of multi-pitched car horns was deafening. Joel
wanted to go out in the middle of it and yell at everyone to calm down.
Seriously, it wasn&#8217;t the end of the world. <em>Geez</em>.</p>
<p>As they approached the next stop, Whoorsley, Joel noticed a man running brea
thlessly towards the train from the highway entrance. <em>He&#8217;ll never make it </em>,
Joel thought as the train slowed down for the stop. As the passengers boarded
and departed, Joel poked his head out looking for the man. There was no way he
could make it without a little help. He discreetly dropped his backpack to the
floor, making sure it obstructed the door closing mechanism just enough to
prevent the train from&nbsp;departing.</p>
<p>The passengers grew increasingly agitated as the annoying prerecorded voice
said, “Doors closing,” over and over again, but no one noticed Joel&#8217;s
surreptitiously placed&nbsp;backpack.</p>
<p>The man boarded a few seconds later, and there was a sigh of relief from all
the passengers when the final “Doors closing” warning was repeated. Joel
leaned back against the train door, awash in the glow that came with doing
good deeds. His place in heaven was assured, no doubt about <em>that</em>. He&nbsp;smiled.</p>
