                                    <p>Guh. I hate being sick. And of course it has to hit me during my four-day
Thanksgiving weekend. To make matters worse, today is the <strong>only</strong> day this
entire weekend that has been sunny. I&#8217;ll probably force myself to hobble
outside at some point to get some vitamin E, though. You can&#8217;t waste a day
like this, considering what the weather&#8217;s been like out here&nbsp;lately.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel like I&#8217;ve got malaria. I know it isn&#8217;t (if it was, I&#8217;d still be
in bed), but the nausea and fever/chills reminds me too much of it. Oh well,
even if it is, I&#8217;ve survived it before, so I can do it again. The only
thing that would make this suck less is if my mom was here. She would serve me
soup and Sprite until I felt better. Mmmm&#8230; Luckily mom and dad&#8217;ll be
back in the <span class="caps">US</span> this Christmas, so maybe I can get sick again while they&#8217;re
here. Gotta live it up while you&nbsp;can.</p>

                                    <p>Since I&#8217;ve moved out here to Seattle, I have discovered a ton of awesome new
music. There are a ton of good local bands (Modest Mouse, Death Cab for Cutie,
Presidents of the <span class="caps">USA</span>, and of course Pearl Jam&#8230;), and several more great
ones from Portland (The Decemberists, for example). Plus thre is a great
support for local bands and good music in general from the radio stations out
here, especially 107.7 The End. For all the complaining I do about Seattle,
the music scene is pretty good, and much more accessible than Chicago&#8217;s (I do
still terribly miss 97.1 The Drive, though. Thank God for internet radio&nbsp;broadcasting!)</p>
<p>Anyway, it would take me forever to write individual reviews about all the
great music I&#8217;ve found, so I&#8217;m just going to give brief synopsis of some of
the best new stuff I&#8217;ve been listening&nbsp;to.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.MorningwoodRocks.com">Morningwood</a></h2>
<p>The End has a new music show every weeknight, and I have heard some fantasic
stuff on it, including this band. You can stream a couple of their songs
online from their website, <a href="http://www.morningwoodrocks.com/">MorningwoodRocks.com</a> (<a href="http://www.morningwoodrocks.com/music.asp">direct link to the
music page here</a>). You have to listen to The Nth Degree - it&#8217;s so awesome.
Reminds me a bit of The New Pornographers for some reason. It&#8217;s very poppy,
but it works somehow without sounding too bubblegum. I was <strong>psyched</strong> when I
found out you can buy some of their stuff in the iTunes Music Store! When I
played it for my friend Dan, he said, &#8220;I want more Morningwood!&#8221; I heartily&nbsp;concur.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/artist/_/id/7292717">The&nbsp;Books</a></h2>
<p>This summer at Microsoft, while our intern population was quite high, I
started a music-listening thing. We&#8217;d get together in a conference room and
everyone would play a song they thought no one else had heard. We only met a
few times, but I am definitely doing it again next year. This band was one
that a guy named Gilbert Bernstein brought in. Fantastic stuff. He played the
song &#8220;Tokyo&#8221; for us, and it remains my favorite. Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t find
any of their stuff on iTunes, but Rolling Stone has some more info on them,
and you can buy the discs from Amazon if you can&#8217;t find it anywhere else. If
you want to have a listen beforehand, try Tokyo for starters. Stylistically
it&#8217;s pretty indicative of what you can expect from them. Good&nbsp;stuff.</p>

                                    <p>When I told people I was moving out to Puget Sound earlier this year, a common
reaction was, &#8220;I hope you like rain.&#8221; When I got here in late March, though,
the weather was beautiful, and it remained so until the last couple of weeks.
I knew it was too good to be true. To get an idea of what I&#8217;ll be dealing with
for the rest of the winter, look at what my <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> weather widget
tells&nbsp;me&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>November is nigh upon me, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to fully participate
in <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a> this year like <a href="/2004/11/tyler-a-novelist/">I did last year</a>. Between the job
and the working out, I&#8217;m simply not going to have the time for a 50,000
word novel this year. It really is a shame, since I had a couple of good
ideas. Oh well, store them up for the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>I am, however, considering trying to complete a short story during the month.
I have a few ideas&#8230; They&#8217;re listed below, along with some possible quotes
from the story and some pros and cons about doing one. After you&#8217;ve read the
descriptions, vote for your favorite on the left of the&nbsp;site&#8230;</p>
<h2>Sex, Drugs, and&nbsp;Polka</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A semi-autobiographical story about a guy who goes to
college and deals with the overall college experience. He figures most of it
out, but the fairer sex leaves him utterly confused &#8211; that is, until he meets
<em>her</em>. (This makes it sound really cheesy &#8211; I don&#8217;t think it will be once I
get it&nbsp;written.)</p>
<p><strong>Possible&nbsp;excerpts:</strong> </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Years later he would think back in awe of the
squander in which he now lived &#8211; but at this very moment, it was home, and a
good one at&nbsp;that.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>He had the fleeting thought that all men of his generation had. &#8216;Am I&nbsp;gay?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>In his heart he knew that what he really wanted was a meaningful relationship
filled with trust, sacrifice, and love, culminating in marriage and a slow
ride into the proverbial sunset of his later years with his beautiful bride;
for now, though, he&#8217;d settle for a passionate make-out session in the corner
with some girl whose name he wouldn&#8217;t remember&nbsp;tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Will give me a chance to get some of my college experiences out on
paper (with some fictional embellishments, of course) before middle-age sets
in and I forget it all. Plus, would be a lot of fun for my friends to read
since they&#8217;ll probably make&nbsp;appearances.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Far too much for a short story &#8211; I doubt I&#8217;ll ever finish it once
I start, because there&#8217;s too much material to work&nbsp;with.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;Hill</h2>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A children&#8217;s story about friendship. A boy grows up with a
hill in his back yard, and when he grows older, a construction company buys
the property and threatens to flatten the hill, so the boy has to find a way
to save it &#8211; or say&nbsp;goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>Possible excerpts:</strong> Hmmm, I can&#8217;t find them right now&#8230; I know they&#8217;re&nbsp;somewhere&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> I like to experiment with different styles (Mike&#8217;s character in
<a href="/tags/novel/">Knot</a> was an experiment with anger and rage), so it would be interesting
to try my hand at a children&#8217;s story, with some simpler language and richer
descriptions. The presence of a non-talking character (the Hill) would allow
me to forgo dialog and focus more on description (one of my weaker points, I&nbsp;think).</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Might be kind of boring, and difficult to prevent sounding cheesy
or overly didactic. The core concept isn&#8217;t very original&nbsp;either.</p>
<h2>The Children&#8217;s&nbsp;Democracy</h2>
<p><strong>Description: </strong>A lonely suburban writer suffers writer&#8217;s block until he
starts to observe a group of kids around his housing complex. He writes about
his observations about the way the children deal with each other socially and&nbsp;politically.</p>
<p><strong>Possible excerpts:</strong> Probably the same place <strong>The Hill</strong> excerpts are&#8230;
I&#8217;ll put them in here when I locate&nbsp;them&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Interesting concept to me, and I&#8217;d get to alternate between
analytical essay-style writing, description, and dialog pretty easily with the&nbsp;characters.</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Very little subject matter to use, since I don&#8217;t have too much
interaction with kids. The idea is based on some run-ins I&#8217;ve had with some of
the kids around my apartment complex, but I don&#8217;t think I have nearly enough
material to keep this&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>Have another plot idea you think I should write about? Let me&nbsp;know&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>I saw this article linked over at Slashdot today and found it to be a very
interesting read. I&#8217;ve had many debates with people that think that byte-
compiled languages like Java and C# just have inherent performance problems.
Often they&#8217;ll spout off some nonsense about how garbage collection is
inefficient or something. Sure, <em>sometimes</em> it&#8217;s better to have manual control
over your memory allocation/deallocation, but this article makes a
surprisingly good case for why the perceived performance hits in dynamic
management don&#8217;t even exist. A great read, especially if you don&#8217;t know much
about how memory management works in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
