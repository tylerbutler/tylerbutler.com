                                    <p>Way back when I wrote <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ecm/archive/2006/10/30/building-tylerbutler-com-part-1-planning-and-basic-branding.aspx">part 1</a> of my series on building tylerbutler.com, I
mentioned that I was using a custom sitemap provider to drive my &#8220;recent
pages&#8221; section on my site. I was doing this with navigation because navigation
controls inherently know where they are in a site&#8217;s structure, which meant I
only needed one control in my master page to drive the links in the right hand
section. I was using the <code>DynamicChildLimit</code> property to make sure I only got 15
links to show up in that&nbsp;section.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I started having problems with the ordering of the links that
were showing up, so I started talking with Chris Richard, the nav maestro. It
turns out that the <code>DynamicChildLimit</code> isn&#8217;t meant to be used for that purpose.
When you sort navigation, the sorting happens <em>after</em> the nodes are returned
from the nav store. This means that if you have 50 navigation items sorted by
last modified time, and you set a <code>DynamicChildLimit="15"</code>, for example, you&#8217;ll
get back 15 pseudo-random items, then those resulting 15 items will be sorted
by last modified time. I say a <em>pseudo-random</em> set of items is returned
because even though items returned aren&#8217;t really random &#8211; there <em>is</em> a
deterministic way nodes get returned from the nav store – it&#8217;s complicated
enough that you won&#8217;t be able to tell what 15 items will be returned at any
given&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Anyway, this means that <code>DynamicChildLimit</code> doesn&#8217;t really work the way I
thought and it makes navigation unusable for my needs in this instance.
However, a helpful guy named Bram Kleverlaan left <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ecm/archive/2007/01/16/building-tylerbutler-com-part-6-what-was-tough-and-what-s-to-come.aspx#1512810">a comment </a>on my Part 6
post that he was able to use a SharePoint expression to make Content Query Web
Parts know where they are in the site hierarchy. The trick is to set
<code>WebUrl="&lt;% $SPUrl:~Site/ %&gt;"</code> in the web part&#8217;s properties. This expression
will get expanded by SharePoint at runtime, and your <span class="caps">CQWP</span> will suddenly change
based on the location of the page that&#8217;s loading it. I definitely had a &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t I think of that?&#8221; moment when I read Bram&#8217;s&nbsp;comment.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am using this now on my site, and I can verify that it works for web
parts that live <em>outside</em> of web part zones. I have not yet tried it on a web
part inside a zone, but I&#8217;ve heard reports that the property gets reset every
time you change properties on the web part in the browser, which you can&#8217;t do
for parts that live outside&nbsp;zones.</p>

                </header>
                                    <p>Now that <span class="caps">MOSS</span> is available to lots of people, and people are building lots of
sites that <a href="http://www.fifteen.net">don&#8217;t</a> <a href="http://www.shareview.co.uk/">look</a> <a href="http://www.hedkandi.com/">like</a> SharePoint, a lot of you might be
wondering how you should get started in building your own custom master page
for your site. I talked a little bit about this in my first post on building
tylerbutler.com, but I think it might be valuable to post some info about the
minimal master page and its role in helping you build a custom master page for
your site. But first, some&nbsp;background…</p>
<p>During the early betas, people heard that you could make SharePoint &#8220;not look
like SharePoint,&#8221; and so they set off to do just that. People started cracking
open default.master and trying to understand it. The problem many people
reported was that the markup in default.master was ridiculously complicated,
and it wasn&#8217;t clear what could be removed and what couldn&#8217;t. The complexity is
somewhat necessary for that master page because of all the delegate controls
we have to put in place to support a bunch of different back-end SharePoint
stuff (I do believe, however, that there&#8217;s plenty of things we could/can do in
that master page to make it clearer and easier to customize without removing
functionality, so this is not meant to be an&nbsp;excuse).</p>
<p>Anyway, there were customers that were trying to build internet facing sites
on top of SharePoint, because <strong>a)</strong> we told them that they could/should and
<strong>b)</strong> we rolled up a lot of web content management functionality from Content
Management Server 2002, and customers that were using that product were
investigating how they would move to <span class="caps">MOSS</span>. These customers did not want their
site to look anything like SharePoint. These customers also often had a site
design template that was coming from their design team, either in <span class="caps">HTML</span> or as
image mock-ups. Trying to fit that design into default.master was exceedingly
difficult because of all the unclear markup in that master page.
Default.master is designed for a SharePoint site – one that looks and acts
like SharePoint. But people who wanted to build non-SharePoint looking sites
were getting tripped up by using it as a starting&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>We do have several master pages that we built that are much simpler than
default.master. When you provision a Publishing Portal site collection, for
example, we default to BlueBand.master, which has customized <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">MOSS</span>
navigation out of the box. It&#8217;s a cleaner starting point, so we initially told
people to start there rather than with default.master. We still had problems,
though, because you never knew if a placeholder was absolutely necessary in
your master page. What would happen is you&#8217;d remove a seemingly innocuous
placeholder and your page would work fine until you browsed to some specific
page that was overriding that placeholder, then things would&nbsp;break.</p>
<p>What we needed was a sample master page that included only the markup that was
<em>absolutely necessary to get your pages to render.</em> Thus, the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa660698.aspx">minimal master
page</a> was born. This master page is purposely bare. It&#8217;s just a bunch of
placeholders – those placeholders are necessary for things in your site to
work properly. With this master page, you can take your markup from your
designer, paste it into SharePoint Designer, and move markups into the
appropriate placeholders. If there&#8217;s some pieces you need/want from
default.master or another page, you can always open them up and copy/paste the
appropriate&nbsp;markup.</p>
<p>So, should you start with <code>default.master</code>, <code>blueband.master</code>, or the minimal
master page example when building your own custom master page? Well, the
answer depends on what you&#8217;re trying to do. If you&#8217;re building out a site that
really should look and work like vanilla SharePoint, then maybe <code>default.master</code>
makes sense. If you&#8217;re trying to do something more exotic, <code>blueband.master</code> and
its siblings have examples of different navigational structures and color
schemes, so maybe it makes sense to start from one of those that is close to
the navigation/color you&#8217;re aiming for. But my personal recommendation is to
start with the minimal page and copy/paste the appropriate controls/markup
from other master pages as necessary. This ensures you get only what you need
and want in your page, rather than having to weed through a bunch of markup to
get rid of stuff that doesn&#8217;t <em>look</em> like it&#8217;s needed. If you do want to go
the default.master route, then Heather Solomon has <a href="http://heathersolomon.com/blog/archive/2007/01/26/6153.aspx">a custom master page</a>
that she&#8217;s tweaked from <code>default.master</code> to make things cleaner and more&nbsp;straightforward.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you figure out how to get started building out your site
look and feel. There is a growing number of live custom sites on top of <span class="caps">MOSS</span>,
and it&#8217;s exciting to see what people are able to build with this&nbsp;product!</p>

                                    <p>Someone came by my office today and asked me if I could show him how to make a
column on a SharePoint list required. No problem! While this isn&#8217;t as simple
as it could be, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. Go into the list you want to
change, select <strong>List Settings</strong> from the <strong>Settings</strong> drop down, then click
the column you want to change in the <strong>List Settings</strong> page. You should see an
option called &#8220;Require that this column contains information.&#8221; By default,
this is off, but turning it on will make the column&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>However, in this case, that option wasn&#8217;t showing in the <span class="caps">UI</span>. The reason was
that the column was a <strong>Yes/No (check box)</strong> field. Now, if you think about
it, this makes sense. A checkbox <em>always</em> has state, either checked or
unchecked, so it&#8217;s by nature required. A user always has to fill in a checkbox
with some data, either by checking it or unchecking it. It all comes down to
the default state, which <em>is</em> settable in the SharePoint&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span>.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here, though, is that the user didn&#8217;t stop to think
about this. And that makes sense. He just wanted to make a column required; he
didn&#8217;t think about what type of column it was. SharePoint totally removes the
required field setting from the <span class="caps">UI</span> for Yes/No fields because it doesn&#8217;t make
sense. However, the user got confused. He wasn&#8217;t sure if the <span class="caps">UI</span> was missing by
design or if he wasn&#8217;t looking in the right spot for the setting. If you have
a task to accomplish using relatively unfamiliar <span class="caps">UI</span>, you go to the place that
makes sense to you, but you&#8217;re never sure you&#8217;re in the right place. In this
case, the user poked around other parts of the <span class="caps">UI</span> before coming to me, because
he thought he was looking in the wrong&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>This might be alleviated by disabling (i.e. graying out) the part of the <span class="caps">UI</span>
that is not applicable. This is somewhat clearer, because it says, &#8220;Yes, this
is where you would change this setting, but it doesn&#8217;t make sense here or is
not allowed.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t a hard rule. You can&#8217;t <em>always</em> display <em>all</em>
possible settings in one piece of <span class="caps">UI</span> because if there are a large number of
settings, things can get confusing and distracting. Some hiding does make
sense in many cases. But it is worth some dedicated thought about your <span class="caps">UI</span> and
what your users are trying to accomplish when deciding whether to hide a piece
of <span class="caps">UI</span> or simply gray it&nbsp;out.</p>

                                    <p>My site has been going up and down lately. It&#8217;s not a problem with <span class="caps">MOSS</span> or the
server. Both have stayed up and running without any problems. Unfortunately,
the environment that my server is in has been having problems with their
switch. Apparently it&#8217;s rebooting itself constantly, which is &#8220;a common issue
for this brand and model of router.&#8221; Anyway, no biggie, my site isn&#8217;t exactly
mission-critical. But weekends are the best time for me to work on
enhancements, and I have a few in mind that I was looking forward to getting
set up. Alas, &#8216;twas not to be. Everything seems to be working now, though, so
hopefully it&#8217;ll stay this&nbsp;way.</p>

                                    <p>I upgraded to Acrobat Reader 8 last night because frankly, I figured it
couldn&#8217;t get any crappier than 7. I was right. In fact, it got a bit better.
The Yahoo toolbar and advertising bar across the top seem to be gone. The
interface is simpler, too. It still has automatic updating on by default, of
course, which I immediately turned off just in case the update feature sucks
as much as it did in&nbsp;7.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s getting better. But even without Photoshop Album Starter Edition,
which it tries to bundle with the download by default (freakin&#8217; annoying, by
the way), it&#8217;s still <strong>20.8 <span class="caps">MB</span></strong>. My goodness, that&#8217;s&nbsp;bloated&#8230;</p>
