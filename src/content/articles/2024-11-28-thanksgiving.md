Thanksgiving has been my favorite of the US holidays for some time. I've [written about it several times over the years][tg].

When I am away for the holiday, I have used the following Rumi quote as my auto-reply message at work:

> Wear gratitude like a cloak, and it will feed every corner of your life.

This year, though, has been extremely hard, following several other years that I swore were the hardest. The hits: they keep on coming.

This year, a different Rumi poem rings true:

> Who makes these changes?\
> I shoot an arrow right.\
> It lands left.\
> I ride after a deer and find myself\
> Chased by a hog.\
> I plot to get what I want\
> And end up in prison.\
> I dig pits to trap others\
> And fall in.
>
> I should be suspicious\
> Of what I want.
