    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I'm Tyler Butler, a software engineer and designer based in Kenmore,
      Washington. I live with my wife and three chihuahuas, which are easily
      the best breed of dog.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm the creator of <a href="/projects/engineer">Engineer</a>, a defunct static
      website generator, and <a href="/projects/xkcd2">xkcd 2</a>, an
      alternative xkcd comic viewing site. Most of my recent work can be found
      on
      <a href="https://github.com/tylerbutler" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        >GitHub</a
      >.
