                                    <p><strong>Chapter 6:&nbsp;Disembarkation </strong></p>
<p>Joel didn&#8217;t notice when the man he&#8217;d held the train for stepped off. He was
more interested in sleeping at that point. The metal bar alongside the train
seat wasn&#8217;t the most comfortable pillow he&#8217;d ever used, but it wasn&#8217;t the most
uncomfortable either. The mounting fatigue of the trip had finally overwhelmed
him and he would have slept&nbsp;anywhere.</p>
<p>Lucky for him, the McAllister Park stop was the last, and the train operator
woke him with a harsh clap on the shoulder and a shout, looking less than
pleased. Joel smiled sheepishly and rubbed his eyes as he was pushed out onto
the&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>The sun was looming higher in the sky now, and it was beginning to warm up.
His bare arms and legs felt quite comfortable as he twisted from side to side,
stretching his stiff body. He drew in a deep breath, let it out slowly, and
began walking towards the&nbsp;exit.</p>
<p>He considered briefly walking straight home. His apartment wasn&#8217;t far, and
he <em>was</em> tired. But looking around him, he realized that days as beautiful as
this one were in short supply here at this time of year, and he should make
the best of it while he could. Besides, he could really use a bagel &#8211; he
hadn&#8217;t had one while he&#8217;d been in&nbsp;Asia.</p>
<p>He had sampled much of the local cuisine &#8211; a variety of curried rice,
countless vegetables, and fruits that few western mouths had tasted. But the
simplicity of a bagel slathered with cream cheese was something he had missed
greatly during his&nbsp;absence.</p>
<p>It took him a moment to get his bearings. Things hadn&#8217;t changed that much
since his departure, but months of trekking through real jungle had left him
unready to tackle the asphalt&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>He set off east the opposite of his apartment, heading towards the
Dominick&#8217;s that serviced all of McAllister Park&#8217;s grocery needs. He&#8217;d suffered
a little culture shock during his return flight, largely due to the wide array
of various items that were made available in even the smallest airport
convenience shop. Dominick&#8217;s was sure to shock him even&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>The streets appeared to him much cleaner than when he last saw them. It was
certainly an observation colored by his experiences with much dirtier streets
in Asia. Most any street would appear cleaner than&nbsp;those.</p>
<p>He soon settled into a now familiar stride, born of countless hours spent
hiking in secluded mountain jungles and vast grassy valleys. The distance to
the store was more than an average American would consider walkable, but then,
Joel was no longer an average American, was&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>A few children passed by on bikes, sending inquisitive glances his direction
as they sped by. They probably didn&#8217;t see too many young men walking along the
streets of McAllister Park. It wasn&#8217;t known as the best neighborhood in the
city. Joel had ended up here just because it was cheap, and he&#8217;d never had any
real problems. Every once in awhile you&#8217;d hear of someone getting beat up, or
a bike getting stolen, or something, but Joel just did his best to be careful
and didn&#8217;t let himself get too worked up about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He had sublet his apartment to a young couple that were still in school
relative close by. They were strapped for cash, and he didn&#8217;t really want to
give up his lease because of the trip. They had agreed to be out of the
apartment by a month before Joel&#8217;s scheduled return, so by now the place would
probably require a thorough cleaning. The bed, though, would be clean enough
for a good night&#8217;s rest &#8211; no need to concern himself with that&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>What he did need to concern himself with was getting food. His stomach&#8217;s
complaints grew audible as he crossed the nearly abandoned parking lot of
Dominick&#8217;s. He entered through the automatic doors and thought idly how lazy
people had&nbsp;become.</p>
<p>The scent of fresh-baked bread beckoned his nose frantically upon entry to
the store. It didn&#8217;t take him long to find the bakery section of the store,
despite his unfamiliarity with the new configuration of the store. It was much
different that when he last saw it, but he let his nose do the leading, and
all was&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>He pulled a large plain white bagel from an oversized bin and smiled as he
imagined the joy he was about to experience while consuming it. He considered
briefly buying a few more items while he was there, but he he hadn&#8217;t had a
chance to convert any of his larger foreign currency, and the change in his
pocket was barely enough to cover his&nbsp;bagel.</p>
<p>The line at the register was much longer than he had anticipated given the
deserted parking lot. A man with graying hair and a Dominick&#8217;s smock motioned
at him as he walked past the registers. The man seemed a little weak on his
legs, but he hobbled over and flipped the light on his register back&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>“Good morning, sir,” he said, smiling slightly and quickly typing in the
code for bakery goods. “Will that be all for&nbsp;you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I&#8217;m just a little hungry,” Joel replied, smiling back. “Just got off a
long plane&nbsp;trip.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, I see. Was it a good&nbsp;trip?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so. I certainly learned a&nbsp;lot.”</p>
<p>“Good to hear, good to hear. Well, enjoy your bagel, and have a nice&nbsp;day.”</p>
<p>“You too&#8230;” Joel glanced at the man&#8217;s name tag. “&#8230;Ned. I&#8217;ll see you
later.” They both smiled at each other again. Joel was grateful for the
conversation. The man sounded tired, but he had made a concerted effort to be
friendly and engage with Joel. It was a quality he hadn&#8217;t seen a lot of since
his return, and it was something he knew he&#8217;d miss from his&nbsp;trip.</p>
<p><em>[Insert another Asia back story&nbsp;here.]</em></p>
<p>He exited the store and began making his way back towards his apartment. The
bagel was heavenly delicious, and for a time he became so lost in its flavor
that he didn&#8217;t pay attention to where he was going. When he finally realized
he&#8217;d missed a turn and was headed down the wrong street, it had turned eerily
quiet and deserted. The sudden lack of sound struck him as strange, and he
peered around in a vain attempt to get his&nbsp;bearings.</p>
<p>It was not in Joel&#8217;s nature to get nervous, but something about the air made
the hairs on the back of his neck stand at full attention. He felt for a
moment like a lawman from the wild west, stepping out into the main street of
a seemingly deserted town, expecting ambush, but not knowing from where it
would come. A newspaper, floating lazily by on the breeze, so tumbleweed-like,
did nothing to erase the image from his&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>In the silence, the unexpected <strong>bang! </strong> from the east was startlingly
stentorian. His mind stumbled for a moment &#8211; was it a shot, a firecracker, or
what? Then he just started running, not really knowing why. Instead of running
away from the sound, he ran <em>towards</em> it. It didn&#8217;t make much sense, he knew,
but he felt that east was the only direction that made sense to run in. He
couldn&#8217;t explain it, and the question of why he ran towards it instead of away
would later plague him, but for now, he was&nbsp;running.</p>
<p>As he drew closer to the source of the sound, voices became&nbsp;clearer.</p>
<p>“Holy shit, man! Why&#8217;d you do&nbsp;that?”</p>
<p>“I wasn&#8217;t tryin&#8217; to hit him! He jumped out of the way&#8230; I don&#8217;t know&#8230;&nbsp;Shit!”</p>
<p>“We&#8217;d better get the hell out of here,&nbsp;man.”</p>
<p>Joel emerged from an alley and saw what had transpired. Two men, the
apparent sources of the screaming, were standing in the opposite corner of the
alley, facing a dumpster, hands waving animatedly. One held a gun. Well, that
answered his question about what caused the&nbsp;bang.</p>
<p>Joel froze in his tracks almost immediately, but the men noticed him quickly
and he soon found himself eying the barrel of the&nbsp;pistol.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t move, man.&nbsp;Shit!”</p>
<p>“Come on Charlie, let&#8217;s get out of&nbsp;here!”</p>
<p>“No man, he&#8217;s seen us, he can <span class="caps">ID</span>&nbsp;us.”</p>
<p>“Just forget it, Charlie. Come on, let&#8217;s go. We&#8217;re already in deep shit&nbsp;man.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and this&#8217;ll make it&nbsp;worse.”</p>
<p>Both men approached Joel slowly; Joel stood&nbsp;frozen.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry, guys&#8230; I won&#8217;t say a thing&#8230; I just took a wrong turn, you
know. I just want to get home&#8230; Either one of you know where Western is from
here?” He tried to steady the shaking in his voice. Who&#8217;d have thought having
a gun pointed at you could reduce you to jelly so&nbsp;quickly?</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know where Western is,” replied the man with the gun. “But I think
you&#8217;ll be needin&#8217; more than directions to get&nbsp;there.”</p>
<p>Joel didn&#8217;t even hear the shot. He was suddenly on the ground, a sharp pain
in his belly, nausea washing over him. He blinked and tried to focus as the
men turned and ran, feet pounding hard on the&nbsp;asphalt.</p>
<p>“Shit! Charlie, you&#8217;re a fuckin&#8217;&nbsp;idiot!”</p>
<p>Joel groaned. His head was swimming. What had happened? He looked down at
his stomach and was surprised to see a hole that hadn&#8217;t been there before.
Where did that come from? He tried to stand, but found any attempt to use his
abdominal muscles sent wave after wave of pain coursing through his&nbsp;body.</p>
<p>He rolled over, and that&#8217;s when he noticed the crooked body beyond the
dumpster. It wasn&#8217;t moving. Joel steeled himself against the pain and pushed
upwards with one hand, using the other to hold his aching stomach. His mind
still wasn&#8217;t entirely clear, but he knew he had to help the other guy crumpled
there and get himself some help. He put his left arm under the man&#8217;s shoulder
and lifted upward with all his might, keeping his right hand pressed against
his&nbsp;abdomen.</p>
<p>The blood ran out over his fingers and dropped silently onto the asphalt as
he dragged himself and his new companion out of the alley. He didn&#8217;t know
where he was headed &#8211; he hoped the right direction. He made it about a block
before an unexpected wave of lightheadedness hit him. He was suddenly falling
towards a field of daffodils and butterflies, and then,&nbsp;nothing.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 4:&nbsp;Mike</strong></p>
<p>_Come on, come on&#8230; Just start already! _Another wheeze and gasp from the
engine, but it still wouldn&#8217;t fully turn over. “Dammit!” Mike shouted as he
smashed his right fist down against the front dashboard, cracking the brittle,
sun-bleached plastic of the air&nbsp;vents.</p>
<p>The day had not been going well. Come to think of it, the week, the month,
the <em>year</em> had not been going well. But today had been especially trying.
Marie had given him crap again for coming in late last night, he&#8217;d overslept
and got on the highway later than he&#8217;d hoped (no thanks to Marie, who hadn&#8217;t
been persistent enough in making roll out of bed), and now the car was <em>not</em>&nbsp;cooperating.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous. Any other day but this one! Today was important! Today
was the meeting about the Richmond account &#8211; his account. An account that he
had nursed from its infancy at Copeland. An account that he had brought to the
company himself. Copeland didn&#8217;t even know Richmond <em>existed</em> until he&#8217;d
brought it in. And he&#8217;d turned the account into a cash cow. Mike Turner was
totally responsible for turning Copeland Advertising into a large, well-
respected firm, and he wasn&#8217;t getting any credit at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Not enough, anyway. And these new executives &#8211; young enough to be his
children &#8211; were coming in, acting like _they&#8217;d _ built the company, yanking
his talented staff away and putting them under other, less adept leaders. Then
they had the audacity to complain when the returns on the Richmond account
weren&#8217;t as high as usual. How could he be expected to produce results when
they were giving crappy, unskilled kids to work with? Most of these kids
didn&#8217;t know Z-Form advertising from their ass. And he was expected not only to
train them, but use them to produce high-quality advertising for the company&#8217;s
biggest account. Yeah, right, the logic made&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>And these kids &#8211; all they knew how to do was use a computer. If they
couldn&#8217;t do it digitally, they couldn&#8217;t do it. Not an ounce of artistic talent
between them. They only knew how to click a few buttons, move a cursor around
a screen, and hit the print key. Mike had come in with a few physical mock-ups
and these kids were amazed. “This must have taken you so long,” they
exclaimed. Damn kids, with their skateboards, their body-art, their Japanese
anime bullshit. They didn&#8217;t know jack about advertising. How the hell did they
get&nbsp;degrees?</p>
<p>Today was the day he was going to fix the problems. The bigwigs upstairs
wanted to talk Richmond , and Mike was ready. He&#8217;d prepared several new ideas
for the account, and had outlined a plan to rejuvenate Copeland&#8217;s advertising
efforts. He&#8217;d even formulated a sound argument to get some of the more
seasoned staff back on his team. Surely they could listen to reason. After
all, it was the least the company could do for him. And the Richmond guys were
ready to sign a contract renewal, provided Mike could produce some quality
mock-ups for the new campaign. A renewed contract meant a bonus for Mike &#8211; a
bonus he desperately&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>But now the damn car wouldn&#8217;t start. He&#8217;d asked Marie three weeks ago to
take it to the mechanic while he was at work, but apparently she hadn&#8217;t. She
wasn&#8217;t good for much of anything these days. She was a decent cook, though,
and he kept her around as a back-up if he couldn&#8217;t get any from the younger,
more lithe interns. A man had needs,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Besides, in his occupation, he needed a wife &#8211; someone he could bring to
company functions and provide his account-holders a sense of stability and
constancy. The latest in a string of vacuous office biddies wasn&#8217;t the best
choice for a dinner companion if clients were present; they needed to see him
as reliable, honest, and consistent, even if none of those words had ever
accurately described&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>This was ridiculous. The anger of the surrounding drivers on the highway was
mounting quickly, and they sped by him honking their horns and screaming
obscenities in his general direction. What was he going to do? He could call a
tow truck, but by the time they arrived and he made it downtown, he&#8217;d have
missed the meeting and his opportunity to get things back on track at Copeland
would be gone. He already felt he was on thin ice with many of the executives
– he couldn&#8217;t afford to make a bad impression at this&nbsp;meeting.</p>
<p>So what was he going to do? He slammed his fist on the dash again, sending
pieces of broken plastic flying, and dialed Marie on his cell. No answer.
Where the hell was she? There was absolutely no reason she wouldn&#8217;t be picking
up this early in the morning. Dammit, <em>dammit</em>, <strong><em>dammit</em></strong>! He hit the
dash three more times for emphasis, this time driving plastic splinters into
his knuckles. He didn&#8217;t care. He had to get&nbsp;downtown.</p>
<p>There was more riding on this meeting than anyone realized. He <em>needed</em>
that bonus, and in order to get the bonus, had had to convince the execs to
give him his old team back. And to do that, he <em>had</em> to get to the meeting!
It was a chain of events, all connected and reliant on the other, and he
couldn&#8217;t afford to screw any one of them up at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>In a moment of sudden clarity, Mike noticed the train track to his left,
running parallel to the highway. How close was he to a station? He could see
the outline of the Whoorsley station in the distance ahead of him. Could he
make it on foot? He glanced back and saw the light of an approaching train
pulling to a stop at the faraway Allerton stop. He&#8217;d have to chance&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He threw the door of his black Mercedes open, grabbed his briefcase, and
dodged oncoming traffic and verbal assaults over to the shoulder. He briefly
looked back at the car; he&#8217;d probably never see it again, but it was a small
price to&nbsp;pay.</p>
<p>He loosened his tie and began to run towards Whoorsley as fast as he could.
He hadn&#8217;t run like this since college, and his body apparently took great
pleasure in reminding him of that fact with burning lungs, rubbery legs, and
the complexion of a pickled beet. And this was only the first hundred&nbsp;feet.</p>
<p>The train passed him with about 1000 feet left. He felt as if his lungs were
going to explode, but he kept going. He had to. Mike was not a religious man;
he hadn&#8217;t prayed since he was a small child kneeling at his bedside, hands
folded, but he prayed harder than he ever had that something, some <em>one</em>,
would make that train wait. If he could make it, he might be able to make it
all the way downtown and still have a few minutes to take the elevator up to
the&nbsp;office.</p>
<p>And the train waited. Time just seemed to stop. The rest of the world kept
moving, but that train was rooted, statue-like, at the Whoorsley station. Mike
kept running, sweat pouring from his brow, legs numb, lungs pumping furiously,
blood oozing from the dashboard-incurred injury he hadn&#8217;t even noticed yet. He
made it to the rear car and literally fell into it. The passengers looked at
him strangely, but he didn&#8217;t care. He&#8217;d made it, somehow. Perhaps this day
wasn&#8217;t going to be so bad after&nbsp;all.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: The&nbsp;Corner</strong></p>
<p>Ernie stepped his way back along Sullivan Street . The music was roaring in
his ears again. The walk would get him warmed up; he&#8217;d be more than prepared
to take on the kids at 34 th and Broadway by the time he&nbsp;arrived.</p>
<p>Some of the kids on “the corner,” as it was known to those in the elite
circle of participants, resented Ernie&#8217;s presence, but no one could deny that
he could move. Ken was sure to set straight anyone who argued about Ernie&#8217;s
participation. Ken understood that despite appearances, Ernie wasn&#8217;t a grown-
up, and the rest of the kids had nothing to fear from&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>A rising rhythm in the music caused a requisite wave to ripple through
Ernie&#8217;s body. He loved that part of the song. In a sudden burst of
inspiration, he jumped up, spun 180 degrees and landed on his back heels,
still moving the same direction. A new move! He didn&#8217;t discover that many
anymore. He&#8217;d have to try that out at the corner today. It would drive the
kids nuts &#8211; especially&nbsp;Karen.</p>
<p>Ken teased Ernie all the time about his crush on Karen. He tried to deny it,
but he had to admit to himself that it was true. There was something about the
way she shook her body while out on the floor, moved her hips back and forth,
and seemed to look right through him when their eyes met&#8230; he grinned. She
should be there today, and armed with a new move, he was sure to impress&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>He rounded the corner and made his way along the Dominick&#8217;s parking lot. He
stole a glance in the storefront window, searching for the nice girl with the
blonde hair and a metal bar in her eye. Ernie had always found the piercing
strange &#8211; why someone would do that to their body was beyond his comprehension
– but she had been friendly to him, providing him with the occasional sandwich
or soda on a warm day, so he eventually accepted the shiny metal accessory as
a part of&nbsp;her.</p>
<p>She was kind to all the residents, past and present, of St. Ives, and many
others that had never set foot there. She always had some spare change, a kind
word, or a candy bar, or <em>something</em>. She often brought a pizza out on her
lunch brea k and dined with the less fortunate in the lot, or, during the
winner, brought small mugs of del iciously warm hot chocolate for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Ernie could nev er remember her name, but he&#8217;d nev er forget her face. She
always took the time to talk to him when she could, and he appreciated it. She
reminded him of Rho nda, but he could nev er remember her name. She&#8217;d told it
to him many times, but it wouldn&#8217;t stick. She always giggled when he repeated
it countless times in her presence to make sure he&#8217;d know it for next time.
Perhaps he forgot it just so he could make her laugh again the next time they&nbsp;met.</p>
<p>There she was in the store, scanning items over the laser reader and smiling
at the customers. She didn&#8217;t see him, but he didn&#8217;t have time to try and get
her attention. Ken would be waiting at the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>In fact, Ken came out to meet him a couple blocks before the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ern, didja hear?” Ernie nodded in&nbsp;confusion.</p>
<p>“Somethin&#8217;s going on down by the store. Cops and everything! Come on, lets
go check it out!” Ken whizzed by on his bike, made a wide u-turn, and pedaled
up beside&nbsp;Ernie.</p>
<p>“Man, I hope we can see somethin&#8217;. Maybe there&#8217;ll be a body and everything!
Wouldn&#8217;t that be awesome?” Ernie wasn&#8217;t entirely sure he was ready to witness
a dead body. He certainly wasn&#8217;t as excited as Ken, but with something this
exciting going on, it was doubtful anyone would be at the corner&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The fla shing red and blue of the emergency vehicles were visible a few
blocks from the convenience store. Ken sped up and pedaled on ahead, leaving
Ernie alone with his thoughts for a few moments. All he really wanted to do
was jive down on the corner. Maybe he should just go back towards St. Ives and
jive by himself for the day. No, eventually the kids would get bored or
realize they weren&#8217;t going to see anything, and the corner would ramp back up
to it&#8217;s usual buzz of activity. He&#8217;d just have to wait it&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>As he approached Ken&#8217;s chosen vantage point, men in blue police uniforms
were wheeling a gurney into the back of an&nbsp;ambulance.</p>
<p>“Well, they ain&#8217;t in no hurry. He must already be dead. Come on, let&#8217;s go
take a look!” Ernie groaned inwardly, but followed Ken as he clandestinely cut
up the alley behind the store and emerged beside the nearly deserted far side
of the&nbsp;ambulance.</p>
<p>“Come on, Ern, lift me up,” Ken whispered, gesturing at the small side
window of the ambulance. Ernie grasped Ken under his arms and heaved him
towards the window, holding him steady as he himself peeked in the&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>Ernie dropped Ken hard on the pavement as his vision cleared and he
recognized who it was on the&nbsp;gurney.</p>
<p>It was&nbsp;Darryl.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Chapter 3:&nbsp;Joel</strong></p>
<p>“&#8230;like to thank you for flying with American Airlines. We know you have a
choice when you fly and we&#8217;re glad you chose American. Enjoy your stay, and we
hope to fly again with you&nbsp;soon.”</p>
<p>Joel stirred from his light slumber and stretched his arms above him in a
wide arc. Finally, the flight was over. It was about time, too. Fourteen hours
on the plane had left him stiff, tired, and certainly not the most pleasant to
be around. But the trip was over. He wasn&#8217;t in a particular hurry to get off
the plane, so he sat back and allowed the rest of the crowd to clamor for
their&nbsp;bags.</p>
<p>That was one of many things he&#8217;d learned this trip. Time was simply not as
important as everyone seemed to think it was. Waiting patiently ten minutes
for a majority of the passengers to clear out would not negatively impact
one&#8217;s life beyond repair. But if the frenzied approach of the other passengers
was any indication, this particular philosophy was certainly not the most
popular. At least it was different&nbsp;elsewhere.</p>
<p>Joel closed his eyes and smiled, leaning his head back against the
uncomfortable hard foam of the seat. It had been a good trip. He&#8217;s learned a
<em>lot</em>, about <em>everything</em>. He didn&#8217;t know whether it was more incredible
that it had come to an end or that it had even started in the first&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>When he&#8217;d graduated high school, he&#8217;d never imagined he&#8217;d take a trip like
this. Many of his friends traveled to Europe for that summer before college,
but Joel hadn&#8217;t been able to afford it. He&#8217;d attended St. Ignatius College
Prep on a merit scholarship, and unlike most attendees, didn&#8217;t have a trust
fund. His father owned a gas station, his mother was a seamstress, and pretty
much everything about Joel&#8217;s life contrasted starkly with that of his
classmates at St.&nbsp;Ig&#8217;s.</p>
<p>But Joel was a whiz with numbers. They just made sense to him. He couldn&#8217;t
draw, he couldn&#8217;t sing, and he spelled at about a third-grade level, but he
could do wonders with numbers. At St. Ig&#8217;s, he had been led through the
magical world of mathematics by Dr. Alan Sparrow, who had impressed upon Joel
the fact that math was&nbsp;everywhere.</p>
<p>It was a fact that opened up an entire universe of opportunities to Joel.
After he realized that there were few things in life that couldn&#8217;t be broken
down mathematically, his entire world began to make sense. He began to compose
music mathematically, writing entire symphonies and handing them out to
friends to play on real instruments, because he didn&#8217;t play any himself. He
created complex formulas that, when graphed, produced wonderful works of art.
He turned his entire world into numbers, and he&nbsp;excelled.</p>
<p>During his senior year at St. Ig&#8217;s, Joel met his first girlfriend, Sara.
They hit it off immediately, and began dating exclusively after two weeks of
knowing each other. For awhile, life was good. But eventually, as he did with
all things, Joel began to analyze their relationship statistically, attempting
to find the magic formula that would allow him to make sense of the complex
interactions between&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>At first, Sara was amused and intrigued by Joel&#8217;s approach. His analytical
mind had been a major contributor in her attraction him from the start, and
his fascination with her <em>mathematically</em> was, in her words, “cute.”
Increasingly, though, Sara began to resent her role as a mere variable in
Joel&#8217;s increasingly complex formula. It became clear to her that Joel was
simply running an elaborate experiment, and she was the guinea pig. He didn&#8217;t
seem to care about her at all except in the context of his attempt to quantify
human interactions. So, in the middle of their final semester at St. Ig&#8217;s, she
explained to him that their relationship, such as it was, was&nbsp;over.</p>
<p>Sara had not been totally correct about Joel&#8217;s feelings towards her. In
reality, Joel cared very much for her. His “experiment,” as she termed it, was
really his attempt to figure the relationship out and put it into a context
that he could understand. He had a burning need to know exactly what action he
should perform in a given scenario in their relationship, and Sara simply
wasn&#8217;t telling&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>He was beside himself with depression after the breakup. His statistical
model had never, <em>ever</em>, predicted this outcome. Sara should be enthralled by
him &#8211; he was doing <em>everything right</em>! Wasn&#8217;t&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>The failure of his model to predict the breakup was a source of great
distress for Joel. It meant only one of two things; either he had made a
mistake in his abstractions or calculations, or human interaction simply
couldn&#8217;t be analyzed in terms of mathematics. Both options made him shudder.
He was fairly certain he hadn&#8217;t made any mathematical mistakes, which left
only&#8230; Joel hadn&#8217;t been able to come to terms with the possibility that he
wouldn&#8217;t be able to arithmetize human&nbsp;sociality.</p>
<p>The emotional repercussions of the unexpected breakup did not contribute
positively to his situation, so Joel had consoled himself by throwing himself
into college preparations. He&#8217;d already been accepted and was enrolled, so he
found out what classes he&#8217;d be taking, and spent most of his days that summer
in the local library reading the text books and other material for his
classes. In retrospect, it probably wasn&#8217;t the best decision. During his first
semester at college, he became <em>very</em> bored, <em>very</em> quickly. His above-
average intelligence combined with the foreknowledge of most of the material
forced him to look for other things &#8211; some of them good, most of them bad &#8211; to
keep himself&nbsp;occupied.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before Joel realized that more schooling simply wasn&#8217;t in the
cards for him. The nagging suspicion that mathematics weren&#8217;t everything just
wouldn&#8217;t go away, and he didn&#8217;t feel as though he were truly learning anything
in his classes that he couldn&#8217;t learn in a&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>He dropped out after his freshman year with no plans, no job, and
realistically, no real future. His uncle owned a lawn mowing business, and
Joel eventually began working there. It wasn&#8217;t especially difficult work, but
it kept Joel busy, and he had plenty of time to contemplate the questions that
were plaguing him about his approach to&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t take long for him to realize that he needed to get out and
experience the world if he wanted to try and understand it. That realization
gave birth to the trip he was now returning&nbsp;from.</p>
<p>He had saved pennies for two years to afford it. Two years of ramen,
weekends spent reading instead of going to the movies, and shirking vacation
time in favor of overtime pay. Two years of blood, sweat, and tears for this –
the trip of a&nbsp;lifetime.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Joel, the trip was all he had imagined it would be and more.
He had hiked through countless mountains, seen wonders he never thought
existed, and had met so many <em>good</em> people. The cultures of the places he had
been were so much friendlier, so much more, he thought, evolved. His smile
grew broader as he leaned back on the airline seat again and remembered the
sheer incredibility of it all. He had done&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>His thoughts were brought back to the present by the sudden realization that
all was quiet. He opened his eyes and glanced around. Nary a soul was present,
save a woman and her two uncooperative children in the section behind him. He
found his backpack, the sole possession he had with him and ambled towards the
exit of the&nbsp;plane.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of the airport terminal was another wake-up call. It
was now clear that he was far from the quiet jungles from which he had
recently departed. Everyone seemed in such a hurry. People brushed by him
roughly, not even stopping to apologize. It was strange, the difference
between the attitudes of those he&#8217;d met in his travels and the people that now
surrounded&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>It was a transition that he had noticed on this return trip. He had had some
trouble with his tickets on the return flight. The airline in Thailand had
suggested that he confirm his reservations with the local agent at each stop
along his itinerary, so he did. At most stops, the agents were helpful,
friendly, and understanding. One even made several frantic phone calls and
escorted him personally to his gate to make sure he made his&nbsp;flight.</p>
<p>As if he&#8217;d crossed some invisible line, the agents on the American side of
the world turned snobbish, were far less than helpful, and seemed determined
to make interaction with them a living hell. And that was only part of it. The
passengers on the domestic flights were closed off as well &#8211; they seemed to
actively avoid all contact with other passengers, content rather to cower
under their blankets and read the in-flight magazines. Joel had, on several
occasions, attempted to start a friendly conversation during a flight or while
waiting at a gate, but he was always pushed away. He had a lot of adjusting to
do before he&#8217;d feel at home again in this&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>He arrived at the terminal train station just as a shuttle was departing. Oh
well, no matter. He&#8217;d just get the next one. Stepping outside, he realized
he&#8217;d forgotten how cold the city could be at this time of year. It was in fact
quite warm, relative to the usual temperature of the city, but the gentle wind
against his bare legs and sandaled feet only accentuated the remaining chill
he had from the frosty airplane cabin. Yet another thing he&#8217;d have to readjust&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Looking around him, he noticed several other travelers standing on the
platform, donned in light autumn jackets, each one with a serious expression,
talking on a cell phone and smoking a cigarette. Everyone seemed so isolated –
he wondered for a moment if perhaps two of the people standing there were
perhaps talking to each other, not realizing that they were in fact less then
twenty feet apart. It wouldn&#8217;t be that surprising. None of them looked at each
other. They were too engrossed in their own private conversations to care bout
or notice the rest of the world around&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Joel decided to take a short stroll around the platform while he waited. The
conversations he overheard were topically different, but equally indicative of
worried, frightened&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>“I know I&#8217;m late, Gerald. You don&#8217;t have to keep telling me. If the damn
plane had been on time, I would have made it. Well, you&#8217;ll just have to
without me for the time being. Yes, I have the portfolio. I&#8217;ll&nbsp;bring&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Did you get Mikey to school? Is he feeling better? What did the doctor say?
Was he sure it was just a cold? I&nbsp;thought&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;got me thinking, you know? I mean, it was just a little fender-bender,
no big deal, right? But the insurance company is saying that they might not
cover it, and the mechanic is charging me my left nut to get it realigned.
Yeah, I&nbsp;know&#8230;”</p>
<p>Joel shook his head. So many things to worry about &#8211; so many things to push
out of proportion. He silently wished he was back in Asia . Things seemed a
lot simpler over there. He chuckled. He was “home” less than an hour and
already complaining. That made him a true America n,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>The train pulled up and Joel stepped on behind a tired-looking woman pulling
three large suitcases. She was trying to pull them,&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>“Could I give you a hand, ma&#8217;am?” Joel asked, placing a hand on the largest
of the three and preparing to pull it up into the train. Confused, the woman
gave Joel a quick visual appraisal and apparently judged him unworthy of the&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>“No, no, I&#8217;m fine, I&#8217;m fine. Just leave me&nbsp;alone.”</p>
<p>Joel shrugged as she moved as quickly as she could to the opposite side of
the train, sat down, and eyed him warily.&nbsp;Whatever.</p>
<p>As the train began to move towards its downtown destination, Joel found an
empty seat and sat down, peering out the window at the cars passing on the
highway alongside him. Every driver had the same serious expression as the
commuters at the station. Eyes gazing straight ahead, hands clenching the
steering wheel tightly, lead foot on the accelerator. Everyone had somewhere
to be,&nbsp;apparently.</p>
<p>Joel distracted himself by watching the autumn leaves perform complex
acrobatics in the winds above the highway. The seasons were one thing that
he&#8217;d missed while he was away. He didn&#8217;t much care for winter, and spring was
his favorite, but autumn, with its falling leaves, grey skies and clear
moonlit nights, held a special allure for him as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>He smiled to himself as he realized he&#8217;d been absent-mindedly contemplating
the physics governing the leaves movements, and reflecting on the equations
behind them. He hadn&#8217;t changed <em>that</em> much on his trip, had&nbsp;he?</p>
<p>_[Insert more Asia back story here.]&nbsp;_</p>
<p>At Allerton, the traffic on the highway had come to a complete stop. Joel
soon discovered the reason. A car was abandoned in the center lane, driver
door swung open. The drivers rolled down their windows and cursed, at who they
didn&#8217;t know, and abruptly cut off their rant when they noticed the car was
empty. The combined symphony of multi-pitched car horns was deafening. Joel
wanted to go out in the middle of it and yell at everyone to calm down.
Seriously, it wasn&#8217;t the end of the world. <em>Geez</em>.</p>
<p>As they approached the next stop, Whoorsley, Joel noticed a man running brea
thlessly towards the train from the highway entrance. <em>He&#8217;ll never make it </em>,
Joel thought as the train slowed down for the stop. As the passengers boarded
and departed, Joel poked his head out looking for the man. There was no way he
could make it without a little help. He discreetly dropped his backpack to the
floor, making sure it obstructed the door closing mechanism just enough to
prevent the train from&nbsp;departing.</p>
<p>The passengers grew increasingly agitated as the annoying prerecorded voice
said, “Doors closing,” over and over again, but no one noticed Joel&#8217;s
surreptitiously placed&nbsp;backpack.</p>
<p>The man boarded a few seconds later, and there was a sigh of relief from all
the passengers when the final “Doors closing” warning was repeated. Joel
leaned back against the train door, awash in the glow that came with doing
good deeds. His place in heaven was assured, no doubt about <em>that</em>. He&nbsp;smiled.</p>

                                    <p>This was his least favorite part of the meal, but he had to drink the
remaining milk or Rhonda would not be pleased. “Waste not, want not,” was her
motto, and she made sure Ernie ate everything he was&nbsp;given.</p>
<p>He grasped the bowl by the sides and brought the edge to his gaping mouth,
pouring as quickly and carefully as he could. He swallowed, barely, and set
the bowl on the table with a clatter as he shook his head back and forth&nbsp;violently.</p>
<p>Rhonda chuckled at the sight. She knew he hated the taste of milk, but she
couldn&#8217;t afford to have him wasting any, not with as many financial problems
as St. Ives was having. She was already stretching it just to buy him his
favorite cereal every week. But really, how could she deny&nbsp;him?</p>
<p>She couldn&#8217;t put her finger on the quality about Ernie that made him so
endearing. Perhaps it was his quiet, unassuming eyes, always hidden behind
those thick glasses. Or it could be the fact that he danced &#8211; if you could
call his carefree movements that &#8211; his way everywhere, and didn&#8217;t care at all
what others thought of him. Most likely, it was just his mind. He was a child
trapped inside a man&#8217;s body, destined never to understand the complexities of
the world. He perceived things so innocently &#8211; and struggled with even the
simplest task that involved remembering something &#8211; but he had such tenacity
that it was hard not to admire him. It was sad, in a way, that he&#8217;d never
mature past his current mental capacity, but Rhonda was careful never to pity
any of the many down-on-their-luck people she knew at St. Ives. She didn&#8217;t
believe in pity &#8211; she believed in helping&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Rhonda thought back to 20 years ago, when she first came to St. Ives looking
to help those less fortunate than herself. She&#8217;d always had a heart for the
homeless, and St. Ives needed someone skilled in the culinary arts to help out
in the kitchen. It seemed to be a perfect fit, and for a long time it was.
That was a long time ago, when she was an attractive, idealistic
whippersnapper of a child who wanted to save the world. Much had changed since
then &#8211; now she was just struggling to keep food on the table for all the
residents, and every day seemed to drag on longer than the next. Her chance to
make a true difference was gone, and her options were dwindling even more&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, there were people like Ernie that appreciated the work
she did. Even if he didn&#8217;t say it, she knew he&#8217;d be lost without her and the
rest of the staff at St. Ives. And truth be told, they&#8217;d be lost without him
and the other residents as well. Their lives were inexplicably intertwined,
and Rhonda knew she could never leave St. Ives voluntarily, no matter how hard
it got or how pointless it all seemed&nbsp;sometimes.</p>
<p>The scraping of Ernie&#8217;s chair brought her back to the&nbsp;present.</p>
<p>“Ernie,” she said. “We need to talk ‘bout last night.” He&#8217;d hoped he could
escape without receiving the lecture, but he knew&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Rhonda pulled out the chair across from Ernie and sat down heavily. Her dark
round face, framed by her bunned graying hair, was taut as she looked hard at
Ernie, but her eyes shone a compassionate gleam. He looked down at the floor,
avoiding her&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>“Ernie, why didn&#8217;t you come back las&#8217; night?” The questions was simple
enough. Ernie thought hard, trying to remember exactly why he hadn&#8217;t made it
back, but his mind drew a blank. “I don&#8217;t know,” he finally&nbsp;muttered.</p>
<p>“Wal, you know da rules&#8230; You know I want ya ta be back before 8. You
shouldn&#8217;t be runnin&#8217; ‘round late at night by yerself. Besides, you have a nice
warm bed here. Why you wanna sleep anywhere&nbsp;else?”</p>
<p>“I slept with Ike&#8230; he was warm,” Ernie replied, moving his head back and
forth methodically, still staring at the&nbsp;floor.</p>
<p>“Wal, jus&#8217; be sure you make it back in tonight. You know I was worried ‘bout
you. I&#8217;m just glad you&#8217;re all right.” She stood up and patted him on the&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>“Go on. I guess you&#8217;ll be going back up to the corner&nbsp;today?”</p>
<p>Ernie&nbsp;nodded.</p>
<p>“Well, come back later on. I&#8217;m baking cookies, and you might not get any if
you&#8217;re not careful.” Ernie nodded again and stood up quickly as Rhonda began
busying herself around the kitchen&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Bye Rhonda,” Ernie mumbled as he walked out of the kitchen. Rhonda smiled
again. One could never stay angry at Ernie for very long. She knew he didn&#8217;t
mean to stay out, and that he was sorry. He was safe, that was all that really&nbsp;mattered.</p>
<p>As soon as he left the kitchen, Ernie grasped the headphones and put them
over his ears. With a familiar flick of his index finger, he started the music
again, and jived his way on back towards 34 th and&nbsp;Broadway.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2:&nbsp;Ned</strong></p>
<p>Beep. <em>Eggs, they&#8217;d have to wait for a minute.</em> Beep. <em>Ahh, milk, that
could go with the orange juice –- better double-bag it just in case.</em> Beep.
<em>Chips. Nothing special there.</em> Beep. Beep. Beep. <em>Load the bags in the cart&nbsp;and&#8230;</em></p>
<p>“Would you like some help getting that out to your car, Mrs.&nbsp;Jensen?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, dear, I&#8217;ll be fine. Thank you for your help. You have a nice&nbsp;day.”</p>
<p>“You too, Mrs Jensen.” Looking towards the back of the store, he was Ned was
pleased to see an empty register line. He ran his hand through his graying
hair and began to twirl his mustache. Finally a short break. His line had been
non-stop for the entire morning, and despite his affinity for hard work, Ned
needed a break. He nodded at Maria, turned off his cashier light, and walked
towards the men&#8217;s&#8217;&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>After relieving himself, he lowered himself slowly on the small bench in the
lavatory. His knee was acting up again today. He&#8217;d need to take a few more
Aspirin if he was going to make it through the rest of the&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>The door to the restroom blew open with a whoosh and in stepped Bob&nbsp;McCrane.</p>
<p>“Hey, Ned. Taking a break?” His smile was far too plastic to be genuine. Bob
was about 25 years old, and most of the cashiers resented him, Ned included.
Ned was nearly twice his age, and probably twice as intelligent, but Bob was
the boss. He knew how to kiss corporate ass like no one Ned had ever met, and
he was rewarded for it. He was always smiling, always trying to joke with
everyone, always oblivious to the fact that no one liked&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Ned smiled wryly back. “Yes, it&#8217;s been a busy&nbsp;day.”</p>
<p>“Indeed it has. Everybody needs a break eventually, that&#8217;s the truth, mmm-
hmm. Back when I was working&nbsp;for&#8230;”</p>
<p>Ned took the cue and tuned out the rest of the inane story. All of Bob&#8217;s
stories were the same. They all eventually ended with Bob saving the day
somehow with his ingenuity, his charisma, and his I-just-won-an-Oscar smile.
Ned didn&#8217;t need to hear another one of Bob&#8217;s supposedly inspirational stories
in order to do his job better. And no story could improve his knee&#8217;s condition
– certainly not one of&nbsp;Bob&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He already took his job very seriously. In fact, he took everything in his
life seriously, but the job was especially important. Before immigrating to
the <span class="caps">US</span> , Ned had been a well-trained, well-respected mechanical engineer. He
was a wizard with mechanical structures, talented at design, and had a decent
job designing small engines for lawn mowers, cement mixers, and the&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>It was a decent life, but there were dangers too. He and Lavina just didn&#8217;t
have the kind of freedom that they truly wanted, and they wanted their
children to have the best possible opportunities available to them. Life in
the <span class="caps">US</span> seemed the best way to provide all of that, so they&nbsp;emigrated.</p>
<p>Things didn&#8217;t work out as they had planned, though. Lavina had become
pregnant early on in their new life in America , and their finances were
already strained from the journey itself. The pregnancy was long and
difficult, and hospital bills continued to pile on. Ned had been holding out
for a job related to his field of expertise, but at every interview they
turned him away, citing “lack of reliable experience.” It seemed his years in
Europe were not verifiable by the American companies, and despite his
excellent overseas references, most companies were not willing to give him a&nbsp;chance.</p>
<p>He tried everything he knew to become more desirable to the American
employers. He immersed himself in American culture, became familiar with
American mechanic style and design, and created a portfolio of impressive
ideas to present at interviews. He even changed his name to Ned, since
employers seems to have such a hard time pronouncing his real&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Again and again, however, he was turned away. With mounting bills and a new
baby at home, Ned did the only he could &#8211; he took a manual labor job helping
out at a construction site. Most of his co-workers were either in high school
or immigrants like him. It wasn&#8217;t glamorous, but it helped pay the&nbsp;bills.</p>
<p>Ned worked incredibly hard, but he hadn&#8217;t lasted long. The knee injury from
his childhood made it nearly impossible to carry heavy loads for long
distances, a major job requirement, and he spent each evening with an ice pack
on his swelling joint. Lavina finally convinced him to try and find another
job, one that would require less physical strain. And with yet another baby on
the way, Ned knew he&#8217;d have to find&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>When Ned spoke to Jon, his supervisor, about leaving, Jon had asked his
wife, who worked as a manager at the local Dominick&#8217;s to hire him. It was a
dock in pay, and certainly not the step upwards that Ned was hoping to make,
but he was grateful for the much needed&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<p>That was several years ago. Jon&#8217;s wife no longer worked at this particular
store, and most of the other people he&#8217;d worked with in the past had long
since moved on, but Ned had kept his job and continued to support his growing&nbsp;family.</p>
<p>It was far from the dream he and Lavina had had when they came to America ,
but Ned worked hard and earned himself quite a reputation amongst those
customers who frequented Dominick&#8217;s Store # 4534. His grocery bagging skills
had grown so legendary that new trainees were required to work with him a
minimum of 10 hours before they could start bagging items themselves, just so
they could learn the&nbsp;ropes.</p>
<p>Ned was ruthlessly committed to efficiency. He could scan, bag, and load a
customer&#8217;s groceries into their cart faster than most customers could get
their credit card out of their purse, all while holding a pleasant
conversation. He never forgot a customer, he remembered everyone&#8217;s children or
family and asked after them, and was always ready with a joke or short
anecdote to lighten someone&#8217;s mood. Not to mention his uncanny ability to fit
more items in a plastic bag than one would think possible. He knew exactly
when items required a double or even triple bag, always took extra care not to
break eggs or crush bread, and ensured all scented items were kept separate
from food items, to protect his customers from soapy tasting bread, meat and&nbsp;cheese.</p>
<p>Ned did not go entirely unnoticed for his dedication and knack for the job.
He&#8217;d been employee of the month countless times, and many customers flocked
specifically to his line at the front of the store, just so they could tell
him how their new baby girl was doing, or hear his latest joke, or ask for
prayer for an ailing relative. Many women in the local area brought cakes,
cookies, and other food stuffs for Ned and his family; yes, Ned was not
unnoticed for his hard&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>But Ned was growing old. He could feel it in his bones every morning, and he
could especially feel it as he sat down idly listening to Bob ramble on about
nothing in the men&#8217;s&nbsp;room.</p>
<p>“So how about that, huh?” Bob beamed as his story drew to a&nbsp;close.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s pretty incredible, Bob,” Ned answered idly. He had no idea what Bob
had been talking about, but all the stories were the same, and the appropriate
responses sounded nearly as rehearsed as the stories themselves by now. Of
course it was all lost on Bob. He was completely infatuated with no one but
himself, and Ned&#8217;s lack of interest didn&#8217;t faze him in the&nbsp;least.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it&#8217;s a great story&#8230; Well, I&#8217;d better get going. Lots to get done,
mmm-hmmm. Don&#8217;t dally too long, Ned. The candy around your line seems to be a
little out of whack.” Bob flashed another prize-winning smile as he dried his
hands and stepped back out of the men&#8217;s room with a&nbsp;whoosh.</p>
<p>Ned stood up slowly and gingerly put some weight on his knee. He hoped the
Aspirin would kick in soon. It was going to be a long&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>“Are we there&nbsp;yet?”</p>
<p>Melissa sighed again. “No, baby, not yet.” The five-year-old squirmed
restlessly in the&nbsp;backseat.</p>
<p>“Mommy&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Angela, I&#8217;ve told you already. We&#8217;ll get there when we get there. Sit down,
be still, and hush up!” Melissa felt the tension in her own voice. Could it
really only be 10 <span class="caps">AM</span>? It was guaranteed to be a long day. Offhand she realized
that it had been far too long since Angela had&nbsp;commented.</p>
<p>At Lawrence &#8216;s insistence, she had taken Angela to an ear, throat and mouth
specialist, but of course he had found nothing wrong with Angela&#8217;s hearing. It
was with a certain sense of satisfaction that she had informed Lawrence of the
results. She had long since argued with him that Angela <em>could</em> listen; she
simply never <em>wanted</em> to. Lawrence, ever the idealist, desperately wanted to
believe that there was something physically hindering her obedience, rather
than accept the fact that their daughter was obstinate and overly&nbsp;excitable.</p>
<p>By now, Angela should have been bouncing off the walls, but all was quiet in
the back seat. A quick glance in the rear-view mirror revealed an enthralled
five-year-old, nose glued to the window of the beat up Chevy Astro, staring&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>“What are you looking at?” asked Melissa as she followed Angela&#8217;s eyes to
the sidewalk outside. Melissa smiled as she realized what had caught her
daughter&#8217;s attention. On the left side of the street was a man in a faded
wind-breaker walking in their&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>Well, he wasn&#8217;t really <em>walking</em>, he was <em>gyrating</em>. His arms flew out at
odd angles from his body, his head bobbed, Melissa assumed in time to the
music that was coming out of a pair of ancient, oversized headphones he wore
on his ears, and every so often he spun in a full circle and started the whole
process over&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>“Why is he walking like that, Mommy?” Angela&nbsp;giggled.</p>
<p>“I think he&#8217;s dancing,” Melissa replied, slowing down slightly. The quiet
brought on by Angela&#8217;s trance was something to be cherished, and Melissa
wanted it to last as long as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>“Well, he&#8217;s not very good at it,” Angela piped up, with a slight hint of
disdain in her voice. The ballet lessons to which Melissa and Lawrence had
finally given in were paying off in many ways; not all of them were&nbsp;positive.</p>
<p>“Everyone could use practice, Angela. Not everyone is blessed with as much
talent as you are.” Melissa caught herself as soon as she said it &#8211; there was
far too much sarcasm in her voice. Thankfully, the condescension was lost on
her daughter, who was now squirming restlessly once again, her interest in the
strange man now&nbsp;gone.</p>
<p>Melissa sighed again as she pushed down gently on the accelerator. It was
going to be a long&nbsp;day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ernie was oblivious to the curious faces peering at him as he jived his way
down Sullivan Street . He wouldn&#8217;t have cared, even if he had noticed them,
but with his headphones on he was in another world &#8211; <em>his</em> world. A world
where one couldn&#8217;t afford to be still. A world of vigorous, deliberate
movements, of spinning and twirling, of quick-stepping, of fishtailing,
bouncing, and doing it all over again. A world of glorious <em>movement</em>; when
surrounded by such miraculous music as Ernie&#8217;s, what other choice did one&nbsp;have?</p>
<p>Ernie had been out since last night. He had tried to make it back to St.
Ives, but the kids at 34 th and Broadway had been jiving late, and by the time
the last of them went inside, it was too late for Ernie to make his return
trip safely. Ken snuck him into his garage later that night, after his parents
had gone to bed, and Ernie stayed warm playing quietly with Ike, Ken&#8217;s German&nbsp;Shepherd.</p>
<p>Ken was a good friend, probably Ernie&#8217;s best. He had invited Ernie over for
dinner once, but Mr. and Mrs. van Zandt were less than thrilled having a
“dirty, disturbed man” at their home. Ernie had heard them arguing about it
from outside the house, and though he didn&#8217;t understand all the words, he knew
that he wasn&#8217;t going to be eating dinner at the van Zandt&#8217;s then or ever. Ken
had come to the door with a sad look on his face telling him that his parents
“already had dinner plans.” Ernie didn&#8217;t argue; he knew Ken didn&#8217;t have a lot
of choice in the matter. Ken&#8217;s parents had told him not to hang out with Ernie
any more, but fortunately Ken took much pleasure in doing the exact opposite
of what his parents told&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Ernie had woken up early to make sure he made it out of the garage before
Mr. van Zandt saw him. He had wanted to stick around to jive with kids some
more, but it was too early; they were all still sleeping. He milled about the
neighborhood for awhile, but hunger eventually got the better of him, and he
started making the long trek back towards St. Ives. Rhonda was probably
worried about him&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The perspiration was beginning to gather on his brow. It was going to be a
warm day. Ernie preferred it that way. It made him feel as though he was
working hard, even though he wasn&#8217;t. After all, work couldn&#8217;t feel <em>this</em>
good. Rhonda made him do work around the shelter every once in awhile,
landscaping and such, and she never let him listen to his music while he did
it. He hated being without his music; life was so empty, so boring without&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The first side of his cassette finished, and his trusty Walkman soon made
the familiar <em>click-pah, click-pah _ as it automatically switched to the
second side. Ernie turned the Walkman over in his hand and admired it yet
again. His rough, calloused fingers traced over the worn buttons. The text
identifying their respective functions had long since faded, but it didn&#8217;t
matter. He knew the buttons by heart anyway. The casing was scratched and
cracked, the battery cover was attached by a piece of duct tape, and the small
motor made a dull moaning sound as it spun, but the Walkman was _his</em>. It
belonged to him, and only him; it was his passport to an astounding world of
sound and&nbsp;rhythm.</p>
<p>The dull gray stone of St. Ives snuck up on him without warning. The smell
of sweetbread and chicken soup wafted gently across the street towards him,
and he salivated involuntarily. He jived his way across the way, pausing
momentarily while a taxi flew by, horn blaring. Glancing up at the flickering
neon cross above the door, Ernie pushed the large oak door open with one hand
and reluctantly pulled the large headphones from his ears. Rhonda would
already be a little annoyed that he hadn&#8217;t come in last night &#8211; there was no
need to annoy her more by keeping the headphones&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>He took the small staircase from the vestibule to the dining room two at a
time, and glanced around the small tables looking for familiar faces. Lester
was there, apparently taking a break from his occupation begging down on the
Boardwalk, and Michael too, accompanied by his ever-present collection of
assorted aluminum&nbsp;scrap.</p>
<p>Ernie briefly considered attempting to bypass the kitchen and head upstairs
to his room, then retrace his steps back downstairs to trick Rhonda into
thinking he&#8217;d been upstairs all along. Of course, it wouldn&#8217;t work. Rhonda was
already well aware that he&#8217;d been out all night, and he&#8217;d only incur more
wrath by trying to avoid her&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>So into the kitchen he went, head down in his customary ignore-the-world
fashion. He was aware of Rhonda&#8217;s stare as he moved straight towards the
cupboard and grabbed a bowl and&nbsp;spoon.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Just siddown, Ernie. I&#8217;ll git it for ya,&#8221; Rhonda said, moving towards him.
Ernie didn&#8217;t argue. He sat down with his bowl and waited patiently for Rhonda
to fill&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Rhonda walked over to the cupboard, took a nondescript Tupperware container
out, and filled Ernie&#8217;s bowl. Ernie was more than happy to do this himself,
but Rhonda knew it would take him an hour just to find the right container. No
matter how hard he tried, he could never remember which container held the
magical cereal known as Trix. On the rare occasions he did attempt to locate
the Trix himself, he was reduced to tasting each container of cereal to find
the correct&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Rhonda poured the cereal and milk, and Ernie dug in with great fervor. Ah,
Trix&#8230; or an off-brand that tasted remarkably similar&#8230; what a brilliant
cereal! An explosion of sugary, fruity flavor in every bite! He wished that
Rhonda would give him real Trix &#8211; he could tell the difference &#8211; but Rhonda
said that Trix were for kids and Ernie, unfortunately, was no longer a kid.
How could such a wonderful dietary concoction be limited to only those under
age 13? He didn&#8217;t argue with Rhonda, though, because he had a feeling there
were other issues, most likely financial &#8211; which he would not even attempt to
decipher &#8211; at&nbsp;play.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Wal, it look dat man done done it ageen,&#8221; Rhonda shook her head back and
forth at the small television in the corner. Ernie peered up at the screen,
where the President was prattling on, looking strangely determined and
striking his hands against the podium definitively. Ernie wondered briefly
what music he was listening to that could make him move like that &#8211; if he ever
met the President, he&#8217;d have to ask to borrow the&nbsp;tape.</p>
<p>Rhonda was still shaking her head and muttering under her breath as Ernie
returned to his breakfast. Politics made the same amount of sense to Ernie as
finances, so he just avoided getting into any discussions about it. Rhonda, on
the other hand, was quite vocal about the upcoming&nbsp;election.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>How we gonna manage with dem cuttin&#8217; this, cuttin&#8217; dat, not thinkin&#8217; about
dose &#8216;round us ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217;? How we gonna do dat, Ernie?&#8221; She didn&#8217;t
expect an answer &#8211; but the question had to be vocalized in order for it to&nbsp;matter.</p>
<p>Ernie took the last bite of his Trix and stared down at the remaining milk,
now the color of rainbow&nbsp;sherbet.</p>
