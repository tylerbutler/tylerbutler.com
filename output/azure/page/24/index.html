                                    <p>Many comedians begin their routine by stating the obvious differences between
two groups of people. Perhaps it&#8217;s men and women, or white and black, or
whatever. We humans <em>love</em> to categorize other people into groups. Pessimists
and optimists, liberals and conservatives, the list goes on and on. Well, I&#8217;m
not going to buck tradition that much; I am convinced that there are two basic
types of people as well: problem <em>solvers</em> and problem <em>finders.</em></p>
<p>The definition for these two groups is fairly self-evident. A problem finder
is someone who excels at finding problems. That&#8217;s a pretty large scope, to be
sure. These are the types of people that are never satisfied. They find
something to complain about in every situation. When you ask how they&#8217;re
doing, they say things like, &#8220;Well, I could be better.&#8221; They are experts in
identifying the nearly-invisible cracks in the glass, the slight imbalance in
the supposedly symmetrical piece of&nbsp;machinery.</p>
<p>You may be saying to yourself that this type of person is a pessimist, but I
maintain that an important distinction between a problem finder and a
pessimist is that a problem finder can be very specific about exactly <em>what</em>
in a given situation or event is bad, while a pessimist is less able to do
this in general. A pessimist can tell you how bad he thinks it is, but getting
down to specifics is difficult because it&#8217;s not about specific issues or
problems he sees, it&#8217;s about the way he perceives his environment and the
events surrounding him. Hope that distinction makes&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>Obviously a problem solver is someone who solves problems. These aren&#8217;t
particularly complex definitions, are they? This is the type of person
that is constantly trying to save the world. You have a problem? They have a
solution! Well, they believe they do. There is nothing they can&#8217;t help you
with. If they&#8217;re self-aware enough to realize they <em>don&#8217;t</em> know the answer,
then they&#8217;ll happily redirect you to someone who does. After all, they have a
pathological need to solve your problem, whether that&#8217;s what you want or not.
Sometimes, you just want someone to listen to your story about your horrible
experience or situation, and simply agree with you. &#8220;Yeah, that <em>does</em> suck!&#8221;
&#8220;Yeah, that pisses me off too!&#8221; You&#8217;re looking for a friendly acknowledgement
of the suckiness of your situation, and it can be frustrating when a problem
solver patronizes you by offering what they think is a simple solution for
your problem. &#8220;What are you complaining about? Take action!&#8221; they&nbsp;say.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s clear that everyone has a bit of both of these quirks in their
personalities. We all are proactive about solving problems on some occasions,
and sometimes we&#8217;re very good about finding the problems, the holes, the
cracks. However, since I am an engineer, and I work with engineers, I have
concluded that engineers are predominately problem&nbsp;solvers.</p>
<p>This makes sense. What is engineering? At its core, it&#8217;s finding elegant
solutions to complex problems while maintaining an awareness of the needs and
constraints of the solution (such as cost). It&#8217;s problem solving, pure and
simple, so it is not unusual that good engineers are good problem solvers.
However, I maintain that problem finders are equally, if not more important
than problem solvers, if only because good ones are harder to&nbsp;find.</p>
<p>I know plenty of engineers who can solve problems in fantastic, elegant ways,
but can&#8217;t easily identify the problems in their solutions, or even potential
problems outside of the original problem description that was given to them.
They need someone who can do that for them. The best teams at Microsoft in my
opinion have a cynic, a guy who takes everything and tears it apart. It&#8217;s
<em>never</em> good enough. And the best problem solvers I know are able to take that
information and make a better&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>So I guess my conclusion is that it&#8217;s <span class="caps">OK</span> if you&#8217;re not the best problem solver
or problem finder. Just <em>know</em> that you aren&#8217;t. Self-awareness is the key, you
know. In my own case, I have realized that I am a much better problem
finder. I&#8217;m a natural cynic, and a bit of a perfectionist. And hey, I&#8217;m <span class="caps">OK</span>
with&nbsp;that.</p>

                                    <p>It was a bit of a toss-up whether to categorize this post under Geekdom,
Daily Dose of Tyler, or Work, since this project certainly has a bit
of all three. However, since I haven&#8217;t gotten around to implementing arbitrary
tagging on my site, I can only pick one, so I went with work. Anyway, as you
can see from visiting this site, I am in the process of transitioning things
from my old <a href="http://www.geeklog.net/">GeekLog</a>-based system to <span class="caps">MOSS</span> 2007. (A quick note on GeekLog -
I love it. It&#8217;s been great for me, it has a lot of great features, it&#8217;s
customizable, highly recommended! The only reason I&#8217;m moving is because I
helped build <span class="caps">MOSS</span>, and I like it a&nbsp;lot.)</p>
<p>Anyway, you can follow my progress by checking out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ecm/archive/2006/10/30/building-tylerbutler-com-part-1-planning-and-basic-branding.aspx">my first post</a> on this
process at the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ecm">Enterprise Content Management blog</a>. There will be several
more posts over there, and I am working on an in-depth piece-by-piece feature
breakdown for the site that I&#8217;ll put up here at some point. Gotta get the site
finished first,&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>This is a bit of a sandbox right now, as I am still actively working on the
implementation of the site. It might go up and down, and things will probably
look wrong. Feel free to send me bug reports if you find something that
looks&nbsp;wrong.</p>

                                    <p>Yes, I have entered the ranks of the 1337 gamers. I finally gave into the urge
and paid $75 premium to get an XBox 360 off of eBay. Yeah, I could have waited
even longer, but frankly, I was sick of the constant monitoring of the
<a href="http://untitlednet.com/">unt1tled XBox tracker</a>, the random phone calls to friends to see if they
could pick me up one in their area, etc. Anyway, the unit arrived Saturday
morning, so I immediately plugged it in and wasted an entire day playing with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>So what do I think of it? Well, in a word, it is <strong>awesome</strong>. It outputs
beautifully on my 480p <span class="caps">HDTV</span> (alas, I don&#8217;t think my <span class="caps">TV</span> supports 720p &#8211; time to
buy a 73&#8221;) in glorious widescreen deliciousness, and it was brain-dead easy to
get logged on to XBox Live. Once there, I downloaded a bunch of Arcade game
demos, including the utterly fantastic <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/g/geometrywarsevolvedlivearcadexbox360/default.htm">Geometry Wars</a>, which I bought for
400 Microsoft Points ($5) within 20 minutes of playing. There is so much
awesomeness in this sexy little machine that it is tough to write it all down.
But there are a couple of areas that really stand out, so I thought I&#8217;d write
a little about&nbsp;them.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
<p>The concept is so simple &#8211; set mini goals within games and award players
points when they achieve these goals. Then centralize everything on a website
so players can compare their results to all players globally, or just amongst
their friends. This is what the XBox team has done with Achievements. An
example of an achievement in Geometry Wars is the Pacifism Achievement, which
is awarded for playing the first 60 seconds of the game without shooting
(pretty tough when you first start out). Another is awarded when you earn
100,000 points, and still another when you make it all the way to 100,000
points without dying once. You get the idea. Because achievements are super-
public &#8211; you can go <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/profile.aspx">visit my profile</a> on xbox.com and see all the
achievements I&#8217;ve attained for a certain game &#8211; it adds a huge competitive
edge to the games. For example, because I can compare my achievements with my
friends, I am more apt to keep playing so that I can keep my edge over other
players. It also adds extra incentive to purchase full versions of games,
since you can&#8217;t earn achievements in&nbsp;demos.</p>
<h3>Demos</h3>
<p>And speaking of demos &#8211; the online nature of XBox Live allows publishers to
put up downloadable game demos in the XBox Live Marketplace. So if you have
the hard drive, you can download demos of games such as Condemned, Fight
Night, Full Auto, etc. before you buy them. It&#8217;s great &#8211; but unfortunately the
demos are very large (nearly 600 <span class="caps">MB</span> for the Condemned demo), and there is no
way to <strong>a)</strong> queue up multiple downloads and <strong>b)</strong> download in the
background. This actually really sucks &#8211; it means that while you&#8217;re
downloading a demo, or any other type of content, you can&#8217;t do anything else
on your 360. The only silver lining is that downloads are resumable, so if you
get bored downloading something and want to get in another round of Geometry
Wars, you can cancel it and resume it later. You&#8217;d think with 3 cores on the
<span class="caps">CPU</span>, they could spawn a background thread to handle downloads in the
background, but whatever. Its still freakin&#8217;&nbsp;cool.</p>
<h3>Media&nbsp;Center</h3>
<p>The original XBox had a Media Center extender that you could use with your
Media Center 2005 <span class="caps">PC</span> (I&#8217;m ignoring the hacks you could use to get <span class="caps">XBMC</span> or
Linux on there). Unfortunately, there were two core faults &#8211; it required a
disc to be inserted into the XBox, and it was pretty low quality because all
the graphic processing had to be done on the Media Center <span class="caps">PC</span> and then
transmitted through the network. Plus the XBox couldn&#8217;t be turned on and of
remotely (the 360 does this <strong>beautifully</strong>). In short, I bought it and did
not like it <strong>at all</strong>. The 360 changes that. It runs the media center app
natively, and connects up to your Media Center just to start streaming the
video/music/pictures. I think all the graphics processing is done on the 360
itself, so it just looks better and is more responsive. Plus, it uses the same
remote as a typical media center remote, so you can move your large, loud
Media Center <span class="caps">PC</span> (which is what you wind up with when you build your own on a
budget as I did) into some dark corner of your apartment and use the 360 as
your sole media center. <strong>Trust me &#8211; words cannot describe how freakin&#8217;
awesome this&nbsp;is.</strong></p>
<p>Well, there&#8217;s a ton more to say about this stunning piece of hardware/software
engineering, but I am already suffering Geometry Wars withdrawal, so I&#8217;d
better get back to it. I have achievements to earn, after all. Look me up
if you&#8217;re on XBox Live &#8211; my Gamertag is <a href="http://live.xbox.com/en-US/profile/profile.aspx?pp=0&amp;GamerTag=Diametrix">Diametrix</a>.</p>

                                    <p>Thanksgiving is a bit of a non-holiday to me. The problem is that it comes to
close to Christmas. Heck, I started hearing Christmas music in the grocery
store the week before Thanksgiving. What&#8217;s up with that? Anyway, this makes
the third year that I haven&#8217;t done anything for the holiday. I got invited a
few places this year, but frankly, I wasn&#8217;t in the mood. I felt like I needed
some serious alone time (which is weird, because I am alone most of the time
anyway), and I have definitely gotten it this weekend. But I realized that a
lot of the posts &#8211; heck, all of the posts &#8211; I&#8217;ve made today have been pretty
negative, so I guess it&#8217;s time to be positive and post some of the things I am
thankful for. This is a Thanksgiving tradition, I guess, but I was reminded to
do it after I read <a href="http://marcoandkristin.blogspot.com/2005/11/my-favourite-things.html">Kristin&#8217;s post about it</a> on <a href="http://marcoandkristin.blogspot.com/">her and her husband&#8217;s
blog</a>. Thanks for the reminder Kristin. (I also read about her <a href="http://marcoandkristin.blogspot.com/2005/11/well-it-is-sunday-night-and-i-felt.html">baking
peanut butter cookies</a> for Marco. Lucky guy, that Marco.) Anyway, here&nbsp;goes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>: The transition to living in Puget Sound hasn&#8217;t been easy, but it would have been harder if I didn&#8217;t have some awesome friends that make an effort to keep in touch, come to visit when they can, and generally do their part to keep me in good&nbsp;spirits.</li>
<li><strong>A good job</strong>: I complain a bit about my job, but I am thankful for it. Relative financial stability is a wonderful thing, and I know I&#8217;m in the right line of work for&nbsp;now.</li>
<li><strong>My desire to continue learning and improving myself</strong>: Not to toot my own horn, but I am thankful and proud that even though I am out of school and am a working stiff now, I continue to try and learn new things and improve myself. It&#8217;s not just the learning, either, but also the physical stuff I am doing for my body and self. Losing weight has been tough, and two years in braces won&#8217;t be easy (I start the orthodontic journey January 6th, wish me luck), but I am thankful I have a positive attitude about it, and am proud of myself for doing these things instead of just pushing them aside or to the back of my&nbsp;mind.</li>
<li><strong>Music</strong>: I guess this is a little over-indulgent, but I am thankful for music. Both music I listen to and music I write/perform. It&#8217;s such an important part of my life &#8211; I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;d be without it. I have a hard time remembering what life was like without an iPod these&nbsp;days.</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess it&#8217;s kind of short, but it&#8217;s my&nbsp;list.</p>
