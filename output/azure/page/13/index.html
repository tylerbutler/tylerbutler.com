                                    <p>There&#8217;s been some hoopla on Twitter today after a <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/small-settings-update.html">poorly handled
announcement</a> that the option to control whether replies from people you
follow to people you don&#8217;t follow show up in your feed. This was an option in
the Notices section of the Twitter settings that was off by default. The
original post from <a href="http://twitter.com/Biz">@biz</a> made it sound like they were trying to reduce
confusion and that it was no big deal. That&#8217;s a bit naive - they should have
seen the backlash coming a mile away&#8230; Dave Winer has <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/13/lessonsFromTheChangesInTwi.html">a good summary</a> of
problems with how they messaged&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>@biz later posted that they had heard the feedback, claiming it was a
scalability problem with the implementation. I initially didn&#8217;t buy that
argument, but the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/is_this_why_twitter_changed_its_replies_policy.php">description over at ReadWriteWeb</a> clarifies things
somewhat. <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/05/13/lessonsFromTheChangesInTwi.html#comment-9291130">This comment</a> over at Winer&#8217;s post clarifies it further. I think
I understand now, given their architecture, why this would be a beneficial
change for them to&nbsp;make.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m ultimately writing about. Much of the complaining from
people opposed to the change has been that it makes it harder to meet new
people on Twitter. If you see a reply to someone else from a person you follow
then you might also be interested in following them. <span class="caps">OK</span>, fine, I buy that, but
for me, I simply want to see <strong>everything</strong> people I follow say, regardless of
who they say it to. With clients like <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> and <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284540316&amp;mt=8">Twitterrific 2.0
(iTunes link)</a> able to browse through conversations effortlessly, I can use
the tweets from my timeline as a jumping-off point to see the whole
conversation which someone I <strong>am</strong> interested in is involved in. My goal is
not to find new people to follow (though that does happen occasionally), but
rather, just to see what interesting things people I follow are saying. I
don&#8217;t care who they&#8217;re talking to. It&#8217;s not like everything <a href="http://twitter.com/Lincolnator">@Lincolnator</a>
says to <a href="http://twitter.com/MajorLB">@MajorLB</a> is completely uninteresting to me just because I don&#8217;t
follow&nbsp;her.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/we-learned-lot.html">The proposed changes</a> as they stand right now don&#8217;t solve my complaint.
But it&#8217;s early; the smart people at Twitter will figure something out, and
hopefully, it&#8217;ll solve my scenario and world hunger at the same time. One can
hope and&nbsp;dream.</p>

                                            </h1>
                </header>
                                    <p>Back when we were building SharePoint 2007, a member of our Program Management
team left Microsoft, and I inherited the permissions-related features for the
then Content Management Server team, which was responsible for all of the web
publishing features in SharePoint. Essentially, this meant that I has to
figure out what the correct set of permission levels were for our features,
and what lists/libraries should have unique (non-inherited)&nbsp;permissions.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve used SharePoint for any length of time, you&#8217;ve no doubt been
frustrated with permissions management. It&#8217;s definitely a sore point.
Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have any magic bullets or golden hammers. When I
started trying to figure everything out so that I could make educated
decisions for our designs, I realized that I needed to write stuff down.
People always asked questions like, “What rights do Designers have by
default?” Sure, you can find out by going to the site itself and checking, but
the <span class="caps">UI</span> isn&#8217;t the easiest to navigate, and oftentimes what you really want to
do is compare multiple permissions levels. “What rights do Designers have that
Contributors don&#8217;t?”, for example. To help keep it all straight in my mind
(and so I could point people to the info rather than answer 100 emails a day
with the same question!), the SharePoint Permissions “Cheat Sheet” was&nbsp;born.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nothing fancy, and it&#8217;s certainly not anything that no one else could
have created. But still, it has proven useful over the past few years. I still
keep a copy of it pinned to my office wall. It&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory. The
first sheet has a table of the default publishing permission levels and what
fine-grain permissions each of them has. The second sheet is just the
descriptions of each of the fine-grain permissions so I didn&#8217;t have to go
hunting through the <span class="caps">UI</span> to find them whenever I was wondering what the
differences were. Finally, the third sheet is a list of “securable objects”
(which what I decided to call a list/library that had broken away permissions
inheritance and was independently secured) and what default groups had what
rights to those locations by default. This was particularly important since in
general, you want to avoid breaking permissions inheritance if you can, and we
wanted to be very deliberate about where we did, and also track them to ensure
they made sense over&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>So how exactly do you use this? Well, it can be a
handy reference as-is, but chances are that you have your own permissions
level or have modified the existing ones to suit your needs, so you can modify
this sheet to reflect your own custom permissions and keep track of
everything. It really is helpful to have a centralized reference of all of the
various permissions levels. If you go through and put in your own levels, you
might realize that there&#8217;s a lot of needless duplication in the custom
permission level you might have created. When it comes to SharePoint
permissions, less is better, so this can be a helpful auditing tool as well as
a&nbsp;reference.</p>
<p><strong>A couple of disclaimers&#8230;</strong> This was created based on the <span class="caps">RTM</span>
version. As far as I know, nothing has been changed in <span class="caps">SP1</span> or <span class="caps">SP2</span> that would
impact it, but I haven&#8217;t been checking to keep it up to date. If you do notice
errors you can let me know and I&#8217;ll try to correct it. Also, this obviously
won&#8217;t take into account any customizations that you may do that would alter
the default permission levels. If you use this for any of the purposes listed
or for additional things, leave a comment! I&#8217;d love to hear how it&#8217;s working
for you and if it&#8217;s been&nbsp;helpful.</p>

                                    <p>A great post by Garrett Murray about what it&#8217;s like to build an iPhone app
