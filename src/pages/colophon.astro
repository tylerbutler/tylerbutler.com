    <h1>Colophon</h1>

    <p>
      This site is built using
      <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a>, a
      modern static site generator. The most recent redesign was in 2012, when I
      introduced <a href="/projects/engineer">Engineer</a>, a static site
      generator I wrote myself after being inspired by Jekyll, Hyde, and other
      similar projects. Eventually maintenance became too much, and I sadly had
      maybe three users at most, including myself, so I decided to switch to
      Hugo. After porting my custom Dark Rainbow theme from Jinja2 templates to
      Go templates, I was rather appalled with the <i>very</i>different template
      system in Hugo. I eventually found Hugo's templating system to be too
      limiting and frustrating, so I switched to Astro in 2025. But those Hugo
      build speeds... I miss them.

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>
      The site design is based on a now-defunct online magazine I used to read
      and the sci-fi magazines like Analog that my dad had when I was a kid. The
      background image is by Klaus Bürgle of
      <a href="https://retro-futurismus.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        >retro-futurismus.de</a
      >.</p>
      <p>From 2012 to 2025, the site used a custom theme called Dark Rainbow,
      which I designed and built myself. It was inspired by the color schemes
      frequently used by one of my favorite online artists, David Lanham. That
      design is now archived at
      <a href="https://dark-rainbow.tylerbutler.com">https://dark-rainbow.tylerbutler.com</a>.
