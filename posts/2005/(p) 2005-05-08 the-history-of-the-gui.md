I really enjoyed [this article][1], though it could have gone further in depth
about some of the advances made in the 90's. The 80's coverage was pretty
good, and the history of PARC and even before was excellent, but it abruptly
ended with Windows 95 and OSX, and left out a lot of the *nix GUI
"experiments" from the mid-90's. It really made me want to learn more,
especially about NeXT and BeOS (which I have actually used, believe it or
not!) and their history. Thank God for [Wikipedia][2]! Oh, and there's also a
decent screenshot archive at
